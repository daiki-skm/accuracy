Wales on the other hand have a very tough run through to the latter stages of the tournament, with Denmark up first, but they also feature in the same side of the draw as France, Italy, Spain and Croatia, while Belgium take on Portugal in the standout fixture, with Cristiano Ronaldo fresh from breaking yet another international record.Jordan Henderson, who banked a half of football in the Three Lions’ final game against Czech Republic, has moved to rally his teammates: “We’ve got quite a young squad but I think that can be a positive thing. A lot of these lads just go out and play, enjoy the game, play with no fear. And that’s what they need to do again on Tuesday. Go and enjoy it, go and show everybody how good they are. Use the emotion and passion in the right way to give you energy for the game, because that can be the difference really. As an experienced player I can help with that and make sure we’re in the right frame of mind going into the game and make sure training’s at the level it needs to be over the next few days to prepare for that one. Everybody’s confident, everybody’s feeling good and we’ve got a good few days to prepare for a huge game. But a lot of the lads have played in huge games already: Champions League finals, Champions League games, cup finals, big games for England. They’re used to big games even though they’re young and I’m sure they’re looking forward to this one.”Follow all the latest news from the tournament as we build up to the first round of knockout games:RecommendedEuro 2020 team of the group stage with Cristiano Ronaldo, Jorginho and Danny WardBoring or blitz machine: Which Germany will turn up against England at Euro 2020?Euro 2020: Power ranking every nation in the last 16 by chances of winning the tournament this summerEngland vs Germany: Can you still buy tickets for Euro 2020 match at Wembley?Who will win England vs Germany Euro 2020 last-16 match and what are the odds?Euro 2020 latest newsEuro 2020 team of the group stageEngland’s potential route to gloryEngland to face Germany at WembleyTransfer news and rumours: Grealish to Man City once Euro 2020 ends?Show latest update 1624636243Premier League to fund grassroots defibrilatorsSome positive news this evening, with the Premier League funding grassroots defibrillators for more than 2000 grassroots clubs.

We look forward to seeing women’s football grow in success, with Chelsea Women at the forefront.”The blues regularly topped the league’s attendance tables and off-the-field success is now coming as a result of that on it.

Hopefully, I can get the opportunity to play again and show what I am about. I feel like I’ve still got so much more to show this tournament.“Like I’ve done for my club, I’ve been scoring a lot of goals and I just want to continue that form into the national team.“And I believe that, hopefully in the next game, I can start getting involved in the goals.”Adam Millington25 June 2021 16:001624632530Matthaus unhappy with Löw’s tactical tinkeringGermany legend Lothar Matthaus has said that he is unhappy with Joachim Löw’s changing of tactics in the current Euros squad, believing that it creates a sense of insecurity.He said: “I don’t have the feeling I had seven years ago when he won the World Cup.“I was missing the connection between himself on the bench and the players on the field. He changed so many things. He changed one player for another and also the system.“Joshua Kimmich played four positions (against Hungary). He started on the line, playing like a number seven. Then at the start of the second half he was playing number eight.“After 10 minutes, he was number six where (Toni) Kroos was playing before. And then we had to go all in because we needed a goal and he was playing in the back four as a right-back!“OK, in the end we had a result, but how can each player feel confident generally when we are changing so many things during a game? From the position of a player to the changes. There’s no security for the team.”Adam Millington25 June 2021 15:481624631401Euro 2020: More next to come throughout the dayThat’s all from Gareth Bale and Robert page.

This is how it’s unfolded that we’ve gone to Baku and Rome and now we’re in Amsterdam.“The travel’s been first class, I’ve got to say that credit goes to people behind the scenes who’ve organised all of the travel for us and the flights.“It’s not been easy with Covid on top of that, it’s made it harder. We’re fully prepared now and we’re ready for a battle because it is going to be a battle tomorrow.”Adam Millington25 June 2021 15:251624630931Robert Page on support from back home“I’m really excited about the game tomorrow. The support we’ve had from back home, as much as it’s frustrating for everybody, the messages we’ve had, the social media with kids in school singing the national anthem for us, it’s a montage of clips that we’re going to put together and show the players.“We know that come tomorrow, come kickoff, all of the nation are going to be behind us.”Adam Millington25 June 2021 15:221624630693Robert Page on facing Denmark“They’re in the last 16 for a reason. They haven’t fluked their way there and we’re up against a very good outfit. They don’t half work hard for each other.“We’ve watched a few games back, we’ve watched their performance against a very good Belgium outfit where they more than held their own. They took an early lead and Belgium had to change things in the second half to get on top.”On the support for Christian Eriksen:“First and foremost our priority is support for Christian and making sure he’s on the mend, that’s all that matters in life. It’s about him going back to his family and being well.“Obviously the world have got involved with that and the emotion but we can’t get involved with it. It’s another game for us.”Adam Millington25 June 2021 15:18Newer1 / 12OlderMore aboutEuro 2020Euro 2021England Football TeamGermany FootballCristiano RonaldoJoin our new commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesView comments1/1Euro 2020 LIVE: England vs Germany latest and Wales v Denmark build-upEuro 2020 LIVE: England vs Germany latest and Wales v Denmark build-upRaheem Sterling of England is interviewed at St George's ParkGetty ✕Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Pic: AP"We're talking about a very limited number of people coming in and they're also subject to quite significant restrictions," the media minister said."They're not just able to come in and travel around Britain. They come in to attend a match and go away again."We wouldn't have been able to host the tournament at Wembley if we hadn't allowed the players and people associated with the teams to come in to do so."Mr Baker said people are "entitled to be furious" about the exemption."People are entitled to be furious about this exemption for UEFA officials. Look, I want football to go ahead, but we can't have any elite, any elite of any kind being allowed to be exempted from rules which are crippling others," he told Sky News.The Conservative MP added that "people are entitled to be furious about what I think is a breach of the rule of law".He continued: "If we think it is okay to bring people in without these rules then get the rules off." Image:Conservative MP Steve Baker says the 'elite' should not be exempt from the rules others have to abide byThe full list of those exempt from travel restrictions after the government amended its regulations include:a member of the executive of UEFA or of a standing committee of UEFAa member of the council of FIFA or the Secretary General of FIFAa member of the executive body of a Confederation of Football Associations affiliated to FIFAa member of the executive or board of a member association affiliated to UEFAa senior executive of an organisation which is a sponsor or partner of the 2020 UEFA European Football Championshipa senior representative of a country whose team is competing in the 2020 UEFA European Football ChampionshipAn explanatory note issued with the regulations states the exemption to travel restrictions will also apply to those attending the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Global Education Summit.Those permitted to come to the UK for the games will be subject to a code of conduct which includes daily testing, "designated hotels and private transport", Downing Street said.The government "wouldn't do anything that compromises the safety of the public," the PM's official spokesperson said, confirming that there will be "penalties" for those who break the rules.Pressed on whether international fans wanting to travel to the UK for the matches could also be exempt from quarantine, the PM's official spokesperson added that the rules on inbound travel "are set out and remain in place".More than 60,000 fans will be able to attend the matches as part of the government's trial of mass events, which is moving to its next stage.Other events in the summer sporting calendar, including Wimbledon, the rugby league Challenge Cup Final and men's international cricket involving England, Pakistan and Sri Lanka will "also go ahead with greater capacities", the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said.It comes after it was reported that visiting VIPs could be exempted from self-isolation rules to allow them to attend the matches. Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, SpreakerAccording to the Times, the government is close to a compromise deal that will require UEFA and FIFA officials, politicians, sponsors and broadcasters to agree to only attend the games, in a move that would effectively place them in "bubbles".UEFA is believed to be lobbying for 2,500 VIPs to go to the final on 11 July without having to quarantine like other international travellers.Labour's John Healey told Sky News the development was an example of there being "one rule for them and one rule for the rest"."We have seen this time and again from ministers," the shadow defence secretary said.Mr Whittingdale said the decision to increase the capacity at Wembley was based on scientific advice and the government "won't do anything" to put at risk the gains made in the fight against coronavirus. Image:Wimbledon will be held from June 28 to July 11He said ministers were moving to the next stage of its trial of mass events "where for a number of events we will increase the capacity".Mr Whittingdale added: "But at every stage we're obviously listening to the scientific advice."We won't do anything that will put public health at risk."Even though the capacity is going up, people will still be required to demonstrate that they've either had two vaccinations or that they've had a negative COVID test."The World Health Organisation (WHO) told Sky News on Tuesday it is "concerned about the easing of restrictions in some of the host countries".David Nabarro, the WHO's special envoy on COVID-19, said speaking as a public health doctor, there were "real questions to be asked" about the move because of rising cases in the UK.

He went on: "But as a citizen I am also thinking that it is time for us all to work out how we are going to get on with our lives."We can't just stop doing everything because we are scared."Instead we have to learn how to pick up signs this virus is picking up in an area."Mr Whittingdale said the government would publish the results of its trials before step four of England's roadmap out of restrictions, which is currently due to take place on 19 July."It's a complicated exercise, it needs a lot of analysis, and obviously we want to be absolutely confident of the findings before we publish," Mr Whittingdale said.He continued: "I think that people will expect us to carry out a very thorough analysis, we've always made plain that we will publish and we will publish before we announce the next steps."FacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagram About Sky News DownAbout UsSky DataSky News InternationalSky News Library SalesSite MapEditorial GuidelinesSupreme Court LiveSky News Board Sky News Services DownSky News RSSSky News For Your PhoneSky News Radio Sky Channels DownSky 1Sky WitnessSky AtlanticSky ArtsSky CinemaSky Sports More Sky Sites DownNOWSky Ocean RescueSky Academy StudiosBigger PictureSky GroupSky BetSky.comSky News ArabiaAdvertise With UsTerms & ConditionsPrivacy & CookiesPrivacy OptionsAccessibilityContact Us © 2021 Sky UK

Bond, who won back-to-back golds with his old mate Eric Murray in New Zealand rowing's perfect pair in London (2012) and Rio de Janeiro (2016), will compete in the men's eight in Tokyo once he fulfils his obligations, along with Black Ferns women's sevens skipper Sarah Hirini, at the opening ceremony. As it stands now the Kiwi eight are not considered one of the chief medal contenders, but Bond, a keen student of history as well as a legendary rower, doesn’t mind admitting he hopes a little bit of the Snell magic might rub off on him and his crew.Naomi Baker/Getty ImagesHamish Bond hopes to follow in the footsteps of New Zealand's last flagbearer when the Games were held in Tokyo. “Generally flagbearers have performed with distinction in the past over a long period of time,” Bond said after the special ceremony in Auckland on Wednesday night where he and Hirini were unveiled as New Zealand's first male-female pairing to perform the role. A change in Games rules has allowed for the naming of dual flagbearers.

This will be the first Olympic Games since he passed in 2019. In my mind he’s the greatest New Zealand Olympian. He was the flagbearer the last time the Olympics were in Tokyo in 1964, and he won two gold medals on that occasion. “So I’m hoping that I guess luck and reputation passes down the years and we can have an equally successful Games as what he had nearly 60 years ago now.” Bond and Hirini, who was absent, were formally announced as Nga Pou Hapai (flagbearers) by chef de mission Rob Waddell at a team function that doubled as the official farewell. The event also marked one month until the Olympics, which run from July 23 to August 8.Hagen Hopkins/Getty ImagesBlack Ferns captain Sarah Hirini is one of the New Zealand flagbearers for the Tokyo Olympics. Hirini, Olympian #1276 and a silver medallist with the Black Ferns in 2016, said she grew up in awe of New Zealand’s Olympians and the country’s flagbearers. “This means so much to me and my family. Being able to carry the flag and represent the women’s sevens team and the wider New Zealand Team at the opening ceremony is going to be such a huge honour. I can’t wait to represent my country at these Games,” she said in a tearful acceptance speech at a private ceremony which was replayed at Wednesday's function. Bond, Olympian #1002 and about to attend his fourth Games, said he will be extremely proud to carry the flag alongside Hirini, never mind the unusual nature of these Olympics. “It will be different,” he said of the Games that will unfold under heavy Covid restrictions, including stadiums limited to a maximum of 10,000 spectators. “I don’t know what the capacity was ... it will be a different environment. But I don’t think it will take away the feeling and the pride of knowing you’re representing the New Zealand Olympic Team and your whole country on what is the biggest stage in global sport. “It's something perhaps that will take a few years to sink in and I’ll appreciate when I look back. But very much at the moment I'm just focusing on trying to row a boat fast, and that’s a simple as it gets.” Bond was presented with Te Māhutonga, the New Zealand team’s Kākahu (cloak) by Waddell in front of Olympic team-mates, friends and whanau. He felt the decision to have a male and female flagbearer was “a good evolution”. “We’ve got an abundance of quality leaders and athletes in the New Zealand team, and I think it’s a healthy reflection of an evolution of sport and the place that women, who have probably been in the minority of flagbearers over history, now play in New Zealand sport. “If you look at who's odds-on for medals in Tokyo, I'd say the women by and large are leading the way and it’s great to have that reflected in the leadership capacity with the team.” Bond said during his speech his leadership at the Games would be less about his words and more about his actions, and he later reiterated the view that he would embrace his personality in terms of fulfilling his role in Tokyo. “Leadership comes in many styles and you are who you are ... typically in sporting environment ranting and raving without backing it up doesn’t get you far. That's what I’ve tried to do in setting benchmarks for myself and my team-mates and trying to elevate the levels of those around me in rowing. “It's the same in a sevens team – you can’t do it by yourself, you need everyone else to be on board. And we need everyone to be at the top of their games to get the results we want in Tokyo.”Matt Roberts/Getty ImagesNew Zealand chef de mission Rob Waddell. Te Māhutonga was last worn by Beau-James Wells, at the PyeongChang Olympic Winter Games opening ceremony in 2018, and Peter Burling at the Rio Olympics 2016. Hirini’s was presented with another valuable kakahu and named Te Pou Hapai Wahine at a private ceremony with the sevens team on Monday, the eve of their departure for Australia. As the pair were named, cultural group “Te Kapa Haka o Whāngārā-Mai-Tawhiti” performed “Pou Tangata” – a haka created especially for the New Zealand Team by Matua Tā Derek Lardelli. Waddell, who chose the flagbearers, said the pair were chosen as they exemplify the values and culture of the New Zealand Team. “Sarah and Hamish are role models and bring a huge amount of mana to our team. I’m extremely proud to be naming them as flagbearers.” So far 136 athletes have been named on the team. The final total is expected to be more than 210, which would make it the biggest ever New Zealand Olympic team. An advance party will arrive in Tokyo early next month to prepare for athletes checking into the Olympic Village from July 19. Athletes will enter and leave the village in waves, based on their competition dates. Waddell said strict measures are in place. “Testing is going to be a major feature of our lives in Japan, along with strict mask wearing, social distancing and hygiene management. “We’re really pleased that around 80 per cent of everyone in and around the Olympic Athletes’ Village will be vaccinated against Covid-19. “Our athletes know they are in a privileged position and will be taking every step they can to protect themselves, their team-mates, and the people of Japan.”most popularCovid-19 NZ live: Cabinet has commissed advice around potentially making QR scanning compulsory, Ardern saysSurprise!

Maguire, 28, was handed the armband in his first season at Old Trafford following Ashley Young's permanent departure and has continued to skipper Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side. Harry Kane has captained England in their first three games of the European Championship. But Southgate opted to bring Maguire straight back into the team as soon as he was available following an injury that saw him miss the end of the domestic season, and the former Leicester man was faultless in defence and attack as he settled straight into his role as one of the integral players in the team. Southgate has noticed a change in the United defender since he took over as the leader under Solskjaer, and it has made the job of the England staff easier on a matchday. "We've noted over the last 12 months but certainly the last six months how when you become the captain of Manchester United the impact that must have on your confidence, and the improvement in his leadership and his desire to step forward and have an influence on the wider group shines through," said Southgate. "We've got some really important characters in that dressing room that are doing that - not just Kane and Henderson who are the obvious ones but Maguire and you've got Conor Coady - captain of his club - and Kieran Trippier [who is] a really good leader. "The dressing room doesn't need as much voice from the coaches before a game as perhaps it did a couple of years ago. You can hear all of those players getting around each other and there are several others who add in to that. That's a healthy environment. It's a good sign for the team now and moving forward."

On Wednesday evening the New Zealand Olympic Committee will reveal the flag bearer for the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympic Games, and the list of potential candidates is lengthy.The event which gets underway on July 23 will look a lot different to previous editions thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, but some traditions remain, including the opening ceremony where New Zealand will be led out by one of their many athletes bearing the country's flag.The selection of the athlete at the closing ceremony is straightforward as typically someone who was a standout performer at the event, such as Lisa Carrington in 2016 who defended her K1 200 metre title in the canoe, and rower Mahe Drysdale in 2012 who broke through for his first Olympic gold in the men's single sculls.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.However, it is a little more of a guessing game for the opening commemoration, but the long list of those who have done it in the past all have one thing in common – expected acclaim. The likes of sailors Peter Burling, Blair Tuke and Barbara Kendall, discus thrower Beatrice Faumuina, middle-distance runner Nick Willis, and equestrians Mark Todd and Blyth Tait have all carried the flag to open New Zealand's campaign, entering those events with anticipation of a medal.Faumuina arrived at the 2004 Athens Games following a successful build-up with Commonwealth Games and World Cup golds. In 2008 Drysdale was coming off consecutive golds at the World Championships, and Willis in 2012 was a genuine medal chance in the 1500 metre run, coupled with Drysdale and Dame Valerie Adams both ruling themselves out as a flag bearer at the time.At this year's Games athletes are not able to arrive at the Olympic village any sooner than five days before the start of their events. However, such a rule doesn't apply to the flag bearer meaning Dame Valerie Adams, for example, isn't prohibited from such duties, despite beginning her quest for a fourth Olympic medal on July 30.Dame Valerie Adams, shot putAt the veteran age of 36 and attending her fifth Olympic Games - only matched once before by a Kiwi female athlete in Barbara Kendall - the Tokyo event is likely Dame Valerie Adams' swansong at the glamorous multi-sport event.Adams has two Olympic golds to her credit in 2008 and 2012, as well as silver in 2016, making her our most successful female Olympic athlete, closely followed by Lisa Carrington who has two golds and a bronze.Incredibly as it may sound, she has never carried the flag to open or close a ceremony for New Zealand, adding more value to her getting the nod now, knowing her presence is unlikely at the 2024 Paris Games.Related articlesSportJacinda Ardern backs selection of Laurel Hubbard for Olympics23 Jun, 2021 12:20 AMQuick ReadSportWhy are the Olympics still happening?

He has two bronze medals coming at the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast and the 2019 World Championships in Gwangju, both in the 400 metre medley.Adding to his case, Clareburt broke New Zealand and Oceania records earlier this year, helping place him third in the current world rankings.Peter Burling and Blair Tuke, sailingRecently crowned America's Cup champions for the second time, Peter Burling and Blair Tuke head to Tokyo as New Zealand's most storied global athletes right now, and have a chance to become arguably our greatest Olympic performers if they successfully defend their 49er title.As well as Olympic champions the pair are world champions as well, with titles in Geelong in 2020 and Auckland in 2019 adding to their vast array of silverware over the last five years. If past, present and expected success is one of the primary prerequisites to be a flag bearer, it is hard to look past the two.In saying that, what could hold back the dynamic duo is the fact they carried the flag to open the last Games in Rio, and looking back over history, it's incredibly rare to have a person(s) to hold such duties more than once.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Luuka Jones, canoe slalomContinuing slightly along the path of promising female medal chances, canoe slalomist Luuka Jones enters the Tokyo Games with two medals over the recent four-year cycle to bolster her gong chances.At Rio, Jones claimed her only Olympic medal – a silver in the K1, and backed that up with a bronze at the 2019 World Championships in La Seu d'Urgell, Spain in the same discipline. Her form ahead of her fourth campaign is strong with recent Oceania Championships titles in the women's K1 and C1 events in March on home waters.Like Clareburt it would be a surprising call, but also a refreshingly different flavour from the NZOC.Hamish Bond, rowing35-year-old Hamish Bond is no stranger to the Olympic Games or gold medals. He was one half of the consistently dominant men's coxless pair alongside Eric Murray, who won two golds in and amongst six world championship titles. More importantly, they were unbeaten in 69 races over seven years.Bond will be part of the New Zealand's men's eight who only recently secured their place thanks to a sound effort at the 'Regatta of Death' in Switzerland.The fact Bond – one of our greatest Olympians – hasn't held the flag at any point could help his case, but placing a member of a team as opposed to an individual athlete could be too out of the ordinary for the NZOC.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Bond will also be 38 when the Paris Games roll around, making the Tokyo event more than likely his final Olympic outing.

I think when you look at the player that he is and the performances that he puts in around the world, he’s a very fine player.”However, as well as the fierce competition for places among England’s top order, Morgan believes there are still issues to resolve, having previously referenced a “breakdown in trust” between the team and Hales.Sport NewsletterGet the best analysis and comment on the GAA Allianz Leagues, the Rainbow Cup in rugby and Rory McIlroy's revival with our free newsletter. Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign UpMorgan said: “There are conversations to be had between Alex, myself and the coach, and potentially a few of the players, but trying to get those happening in Covid times has been an issue. But they could happen at some stage.“When you look at the players that we have available to us at the moment we’re spoiled, and I think the longer you spend out of the side the further away you get from the position you once had.“Looking at our top order at the moment in particular, even behind our top three or four we have guys sitting behind there that have drastically improved their performance in the international shirt that are taking up a position.”Morgan anticipates having Jonny Bairstow and Dawid Malan available for Wednesday’s series opener against Sri Lanka in Cardiff following recent injury scares.Bairstow required a runner in his 112 off 51 balls for Yorkshire against Worcestershire in the Vitality Blast last week after injuring his ankle midway through his innings while Malan has been managing an Achilles problem.But Morgan, who was giving little else away regarding team selection, said: “Both are fit as of five minutes ago when I walked off the training ground. Hopefully they’re available for selection. Everybody else is fit.”England’s enviable depth in batting has helped propel them to the summit of the T20 rankings and Sri Lanka captain Kusal Perera is aware of the stiff challenge that awaits them.Perera said: “At the moment they are in a very high rank as a team. The batting unit, they have a lot of senior guys in the side. We have plans with certain players, we have to do some really good plans for their senior guys.“I’m confident we have a very good plan and we are trying to go there and express our basics and trying to do our best.”Latest Cricket‘It has been an honour and a privilege‘ - ‘Hero of Bangalore’ Kevin O’Brien announces retirement from ODI cricket William Porterfield helps guide North-West Warriors to four-wicket victory over Munster Reds 'No excuses' from Andrew Balbirnie as Ireland's World Cup qualifying campaign all but ended by Dutch Superb Ireland level ODI series as Little and Young shine in dominant win over Netherlands Ollie Robinson apologises after racist and sexist tweets emerge Most ReadStirling return a big boost for Knights Irish cricket defeats create doubts but Graham Ford has some options Dubliner Eoin Morgan says no offence was intended with use of word 'sir' on social media Joyce has young guns primed for Scots clash LatestDick ClerkinOpinion Further proof that provincial format is fast becoming a really outdated concept ‘Within days, my patio was dug up and my water pipes damaged’ – families say they’re being coerced into moving out Senan MolonyOpinion Ireland effectively halfway through vaccinating population, and the politicians currently sitting on the fence on reopening have no good idea of Delta threat Return to Celtic Tiger era as house prices surge by up to €1,500 a week Two-week delay to indoor dining likely as ‘halfway house’ solution for fully-vaccinated ruled out Independentie SearchSearch NewsIrish NewsWorld NewsLocal NewsEnvironmentWeatherLatest NewsVideoTopicsOpinionLettersEditorialCommentBusinessBudget 2021BrexitIrishWorldTechnologyPersonal FinanceSmall BusinessFarmingJobsCommercial PropertyIn The WorkplaceSportEuro 2020RugbyGAASoccerOlympicsThe Left WingThe Throw InWomen's SportGolfHorse RacingOther SportsDublin GAATee to GreenLifeHealth & WellbeingHome & GardenFamilyParentingFood & DrinkMotoringStyleCelebrityFashionBeautySex & RelationshipsVoicesGalleriesEntertainmentMoviesTelevisionMusicRadioBooksTheatre & ArtsGamesFestivalsPuzzlesHoroscopesTravelReader Travel AwardsTravel NewsStaycationsIrelandReviewsWalksEuropeWorld/USATravel TVCruiseSkiPodcastsNew Irish WritingThe Left WingThe Big Tech ShowReal Health PodcastGoing to CollegeThe Throw InThe Floating VoterWomen in TechAbout UsVideoNewsletterChoosyJellow.ieIndependentShopDiscount CodesSocialsFacebook Twitter Email SitemapContact UsTerms & ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with Us A Mediahuis Website © Independent.ie Privacy

Five Euros winners and bad champions…Date published: Wednesday 23rd June 2021 8:07 - Ian Watson Portugal face the prospect of failing to make the knockout stages at Euro 2020. They wouldn’t be the first defending champions to surrender their title meekly… West Germany 1984There was no talk of best third-place finishers at Euro ’84. It was a simpler time, with eight teams in two groups that were decided inside a week.It proved to be a miserable seven days for the holders. West Germany started with a goalless stalemate against Portugal in Strasbourg before moving on to Lens, where Rudi Voller’s brace gave Jupp Derwell’s side a 2-1 victory over Romania.The holders needed only a point from their final group game against Spain in Paris to secure a place in the semi-finals and they looked on course to get it until Antonio Maceda headed in a 90th-minute winner for Spain.The Spaniards went on to reach the final, where they lost to France. As a consequence of their early exit, West Germany fired Derwell and replaced him with a managerial rookie – Franz Beckenbauer. ﻿ France 1988Spain were beaten in the final by France at Euro ’84, with the hosts inspired by Michel Platini’s nine goals in five matches.But Platini retired in 1987, a year before France became the third holders in the history of the Euros to fail to qualify for an attempt to defend their crown.France weren’t even close. Only the qualifying group winners made the finals and Henri Michel’s side finished third behind East Germany and Soviet Union after winning only one of their eight matches.Michel kept his job until October 1988 when he was forced out after a World Cup qualifying draw with Cyprus, when Platini took over as coach. F365 Says: All Denmark, aren’t we… Denmark 1996The Danes’ performance at Euro ’96 was perhaps a reversion to the mean after their stunning triumph in 1992, when they went all the way after entering the tournament late as last-minute replacements for war-torn Yugoslavia.Denmark were still the highest-ranked nation in Group D, where they had Portugal, Turkey and Croatia for company.Peter Schmeichel was named man of the match in their opening draw with Portugal at Hillsborough, but there the Manchester United goalkeeper was shown up by Davor Suker in the second match, with the Croatia star’s chip crowning a 3-0 win for the tournament debutants.Denmark went into their final match retaining hopes of reaching the next phase but their 3-0 win over pointless Turkey was rendered inconsequential by Portugal’s win by the scoreline over Croatia. Greece 2008The same could be said about Greece at Euro 2008. Their performance in Austria and Switzerland was much more in line with expectations than their staggering win in Portugal four years previously.Like Denmark, they were ranked 11th in the world when they went to defend their title but they finished the tournament as its worst team.Greece lost to Sweden and Russia in their opening two matches. At least they scored against a Spain side featuring 10 changes having already been assured of progress to the knockout stages, but the eventual winners fought back to send Greece home without a point, a fate that has befallen only seven other teams in the history of the European Championships. Ten England stars who missed tournament openers then thrived Germany 2000Germany were a mess at the turn of the millennium. They struggled to find a manager after Berti Vogts retired in 1998, turning to 61-year-old Erich Ribbeck, who emerged from retirement in the Canary Islands to take the top job he had been linked with two decades previously.There was a similar lack of fresh playing talent – and it showed in Belgium and Netherlands.Germany started with a 1-1 draw with Romania before going down 1-0 to Kevin Keegan’s England. Just one point from their opening two matches left Germany’s fate out of their hands but the holders failed to do their bit anyway.They were ruthlessly dismantled 3-0 by a second-string Portugal side which was resting players for the next phase.Germany were sent packing after their worst performance in a major tournament since the war. Never before had they failed to win a single match at a European Championship finals.The embarrassment prompted Ribbeck’s resignation and a review which saw German football get its sh*t together with a mass restructure and huge investment in developing young talent.

Tino Fa'asuamaleaui has also been moved from the front row to lock, while Jai Arrow has traded lock for the second row, where he'll line up with Felise Kaufusi.Young Queensland forward David Fifita cuts a dejected figure after the Maroons' heavy series-opening loss. (Getty)While Fifta arguably had the strongest impact of Queensland's forwards in Townsville, the 21-year-old former Bronco only garnered 110 metres, including 38 post-contact.The Maroons are desperate for Fifita to match the impact off the bench of Blues forwards Angus Crichton, Payne Haas and Liam Martin at Suncorp Stadium - and Lewis thinks his snubbing provides the ideal fuel."It probably will (fire him up). That would have been the message coming from the coach ... When we get the opportunity to put you on the field we want you to perform," Lewis said on Wide World of Sports' QLDER."He's proven previously that he's quite capable and one of the most powerful ball-carriers in the game and certainly one that could make things a little bit tough on the edge of the ruck for the NSW defence, particularly running at the sixes and sevens. That would be one of the hopes.Queensland enforcer David Fifita tries to force through NSW stars Tom Trbojevic and Josh Addo-Carr in the State of Origin opener. (Getty)"And usually, when players are put on the bench after starting a game, they get a little bit cranky about it and think, 'Well, the selectors and the coach - they're not seeing the best of me but I know I can perform better than that'. And that promises great things when he eventually gets onto the field."Fifita started on the field for the first time in his Origin career in the opening game, after taking on a bench role for his three previous appearances.The Maroons' forward pack was massacred by the Blues' in Origin I, with Queensland registering just 1261 metres to NSW's 1841.Queensland selector Darren Lockyer gave an insight into the Maroons' thinking behind Fifita's slide to the bench.Juggernaut Gold Coast back-rower David Fifita on the charge.

(Photo by Craig Foy / SNS Group)0comments HAVE YOUR SAYSteve Clarke’s men will be one of eight that exit ahead of the knockout stages after picking up just one point from their three games in Group D, finishing behind England, Croatia and the Czech Republic.Scotland’s presence at the tournament, their first in 23 years, was a hugely positive one for the nation but the team were unable to become history makers and progress from the group for the first time. Sign up to our Football newsletterSign up to our Football newsletterSign upSlowly but surely focus will return to the domestic game with pre-season having started, friendlies on the horizon and transfer business being done.Here is Wednesday’s transfer speculation and main headlines from Scottish football:Scotland’s lessonFormer Scotland international Graeme Souness believes the national team were taught a “bit of a lesson” by Croatia at Hampden Park. Steve Clarke’s men went down 3-1 in the Euro 2020 clash and the ex-Rangers boss felt the team played too direct too often.“We went too long at times,” he said. “We tried to hit Lyndon Dykes too often. It made us look a little bit like football from the past, like a team from the past. It was football from another era." (ITV)Stokes return?Anthony Stokes could be set to join Irish side Shamrock Rovers who are managed by his former Arsenal team-mate Stephen Bradley. The former Celtic and Hibs striker has been without a club since leaving Livingston without playing a game last summer. Still only 32, he is expected to play a bounce game for Rovers and could be signed ahead of a Champions League qualifier with Slovan Bratislava. (Scottish Sun)Gilmour linked with loan moveNorwich City are lining up a loan move for Scotland star Billy Gilmour. The 20-year-old missed the country's crucial Group D qualifier with Croatia after testing positive for Covid-19. After his self-isolation finishes he will have a break before returning for pre-season. The Canaries, who returned to the Premier League after winning the Championship, are one of five top-flight sides eyeing a move for the player. (Scottish Sun)Morelos pricePortuguese giants Porto are keen on Rangers striker Alfredo Morelos after the departure of Moussa Marega. The Ibrox side have reportedly set an asking price of more than £10million (between €12-15million) for the 25-year-old who is currently with Colombia at the Copa America. Morelos has been linked with a move in transfer windows stretching back a few years. (TVI24) Celtic duo wantedLeeds United are keen on Celtic youngster Matthew Anderson and have made a bid to bring him to the club. The 17-year-old has been likened to Kieran Tierney and signed a contract with the Parkhead side in 2020. Leeds have targeted youth players from Scotland previously and are also interested in Celtic defender Leo Hjelde who had a loan spell with Ross County last season. (Yorkshire Evening Post)Lennon on EdouardFormer Celtic boss Neil Lennon reckons Odsonne Edouard will likely depart this summer. The French striker, who is contracted until the end of next season, has been linked with an exit from Parkhead but the likes of Leicester City and West Ham are unlikely destinations. Lennon revealed Edouard “made it clear at the start of last season that he saw his future somewhere else”.

"If he throws it, DA, you've got to, like, try to dunk it. OK?"Williams was talking to Deandre Ayton, telling his third-year big man that this play, one that the host Suns had never ran before so much as practiced, was for him. It was a play that would decide Tuesday's Game 2 of the Western Conference finals one way or the other, the kind of play that you put in the hands of your franchise player.For the Suns, that's typically Devin Booker -- or Chris Paul, when available. But it was fitting, on a night when, some three hours before Game 2's final chaotic moments played out, pingpong balls were pulled from a hopper and the 2021 draft lottery was made official, that former No. 1 overall pick Ayton had the most important Suns game in a decade in his hands.Ayton's place in draft history is an unusual one, far from any consideration of a bust or bad pick, but also not one of the two guys taken two and four spots behind him. Since the Suns took him first overall in 2018, Luka Doncic and Trae Young have soared into superstardom. Most of the postmortem draft analysis has centered around the trade swapping Doncic and Young, but the Suns' choice of Ayton has remained a casual what-if whisper.Editor's PicksTrae Young, Devin Booker and the NBA's 'empty stats' fallacy4dKevin PeltonThe difference in how fouls are called is warping NBA offenses7dKirk Goldsberry1 RelatedIt roared to a head last season when Ayton was suspended 25 games for using a banned substance, a diuretic. It came a day after a dominant opening-night performance in which Ayton had 18 points, 11 rebounds and 4 blocks in a win over the Sacramento Kings. The Suns looked good. So did Ayton. But after his suspension, and a couple of ankle injuries that slowed him down following it, the Suns never found traction.Their run in the bubble was the foundation to everything this season, including for Ayton. In the past, he wasn't as committed to the work as he said he should've been. It's not that he is lazy or unmotivated, but there are levels to achievement and performance, and Ayton admits he wasn't at the one he needed to be."There were times I wouldn't even come in on days off," Ayton said. "[Williams] would use a thing called smell the gym, touch a ball at least, and he really instilled that in me where I constantly wanted to sharpen my skills and be the best I could be."Ayton spent the offseason changing his approach, renewing his work ethic and committing to being a dominant big man. The accountability from veteran teammates, including Paul and Jae Crowder, helped in the refreshed mindset."I could go on and on about where he was to where he is now," Williams said. "He's just turning into a really dominant player, on both ends of the floor."It has been on display this postseason as Ayton has showcased his two-way ability. He has taken on the challenge of guarding Lakers star Anthony Davis (prior to his injury), then league MVP Nikola Jokic and now the small-ball LA Clippers. His versatility has created a new dynamic for the Clippers to deal with -- Ayton's size, speed and quickness present different problems.And the production has been eye-popping. Per Elias Sports Bureau research, this postseason Ayton is the first player in the shot clock era (since 1954-55) with a 70% or better field goal percentage in any 12-game postseason span. He has had five 20-point, 10-rebound games this postseason, the most by a Suns player since Amar'e Stoudemire in 2007."I've never played so hard from the jump ball to the end," Ayton said. "A hundred and fifty percent. Usually, it's like 110, but this is 150%. And it's 150% mentally, too. Just the level of focus and the things you really have to pay attention to. It's really intense, man."2021 NBA playoffsThe 2021 NBA playoffs will produce a new champion, with the Lakers out. None of the four teams left standing have won a title since the ABA-NBA merger in 1976.• Playoff MVPs for the conference semis• Arnovitz: Young's heroics came just in time• Big takeaways from Clippers-Suns Game 1• Windhorst: Bucks are halfway to their goal• Pelton: Injuries are winning the playoffsAyton might not be the foundational superstar the No. 1 slot is reserved for. He might not spend a decade making All-Star teams or winning awards, but he is a cornerstone for the Suns. He is an example of roster building, an ideal fit in the scheme Williams has crafted to support Booker, Paul and the army of shooters orbiting the perimeter. Ayton isn't trying to achieve status or to validate his draft location, he just wants to make the Phoenix Suns better."He's starting to understand having a role doesn't limit you," Williams said. "Sometimes when you tell a guy this is your role, they tend to think I can't do anything else. But he just has a big role."The cloud of the 2018 draft doesn't follow Ayton. He has admitted in the past to being sensitive to perception and criticism, but put all of it behind him."At the end of the day, we're all different players," Ayton said of comparisons to Doncic and Young. "I'm a 7-footer, big man, and they're two point guards. I don't know what you can compare. But me, I play as hard as I can. This is my team. I dominate the best way I can for this team and try to take this team as far as I can. Other than that, I trust my work, I trust my work ethic, I trust my craft."Ayton is relentlessly likable, lighting up every postgame availability with humor and a megawatt grin. There's an endearing innocence to his answers, with refreshing honesty and humility in every response. He called Crowder's pass the actual game winner for how spot on it was. He admitted he didn't know the non-goaltending rule that stifled his celebration because he didn't want to be a blooper. And he shrugged off any idea that he is playing for anything other than the success of his team. The personal validation will come on its own.His dunk was the first game winner of his career, and as he deferred to teammates and coaches and basically everyone involved at any level of the Suns' organization, he did slip in one thing about how the play came together, allowing himself just the slightest bit of credit."Coach drew up a great play where I was in the best position," he said. "My teammates trust me and my coaches trust me.""And the rest was just off my athleticism. My talent."FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmailTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementDo Not Sell My InfoContact UsDisney Ad Sales SiteCopyright: © ESPN Enterprises, Inc.

In the Game 2 thriller, however, he didn't have it. He struggled to knock down shots from the field and committed seven of the team's nine turnovers. Fortunately, for him, the rest of the team stepped-up to keep the game close late.MORE: Takeaways - Ayton, Payne help Suns clinch Game 2 thrillerThen, in the final 30 seconds, the two-time All-Star came up big.

Great screen by book . Hell of a pass.— CJ McCollum (@CJMcCollum) June 23, 2021And mind you, the Suns' 6'5" guard was doing this with a potentially broken nose - one he suffered earlier in the game after a collision with Pat Beverley late in the third quarter. "It feels better now," Booker said of the nose postgame. "If it was a loss, I think it would have hurt a little bit more. It's good. Probably get some scans and probably get a mask ready."Booker finished the game with 20 on 5-of-16 shooting from the field but he selflessly came up big when it mattered the most. More importantly, the team won despite an off-game from him. MORE: Twitter reactions - NBA players stunned by Ayton's jam"I know his face was swollen. I know he was in pain but that's the will that I have been talking about that he has," Suns head coach Monty Williams said of Booker postgame. Williams credited Booker's defence before going back to his effort on the final play. "The screen he set at the end, like the other option was if they made a mistake to pop and get a shot, but his screen was tremendous." "That's an unselfish play by him," Payne said of Booker as they addressed the media together postgame. "He sacrificed, made a screen and somebody else scored. A lot of players won't do that."Booker added that he had received a couple or three stitches on his nose but he 'was cool'. He'll only have one day for his swollen nose to recover with Game 3 scheduled for Thursday, June 24 at 9:00 p.m. ET. Watch out for Masked Booker!

The closed-session meeting followed a lengthy public session that included comments from players, parents and community members. Since the incident, which spread on social media throughout the county and nation, community members have been waiting to hear what disciplinary action might be taken."This was a racial incident no matter how it was cut," community activist Yusef Miller told the board. "I don't care who stands there and says otherwise. I don't care if they are Black, white or Latino. I don't care what race they are. This was wrong and unjust. I don't care where it comes from."Localfentanyl 60 mins ago Local Support Groups Raise Awareness on Narcan as Opioid Overdose Numbers Rise MLB 6 hours ago Padres Rally Late to Take Series From Diamondbacks This was a racial incident no matter how it was cut.Yusef Miller, San Diego activistThe vote to fire Coronado head coach J.D. Laaperi was the first action — decided by a unanimous vote — and more could follow. As the public session closed, school board members said at least three more weeks would be needed to investigate the incident, which is also being investigated by the Coronado Police Department, the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) and the Escondido Union High School District (home of Orange Glen HS).Coronado team captain Wayne McKinney spoke to the board and apologized to the Orange Glen players and community on behalf of his team."Throwing those tortillas at a predominantly Latino school doesn't look good but on my end, I do not believe we intended to make it about race. It was never about race," McKinney told NBC 7 after the meeting.I do not believe we intended to make it about race. It was never about race.Wayne McKinney, Coronado High School Basketball Team Captain NBC 7's Melissa Adan has the latest community reaction from the meeting. He also said his former coach didn't deserve to be fired for something he "had nothing to do with."Orange Glen assistant coach Brian Gallo disagreed."I think with the actions of their staff that night and how they handled the entire situation, I think firing was the correct call," Gallo said.Some parents accused the school board of rushing to judgment before having all of the facts."You had no right insinuating their guilt for something you had no idea about when you did it," one said."Why was there a rush? I don't understand. Why not ask for cooler heads in this situation? We need leaders with courage," another added.The board did not take any action against Coronado players, but it was part of the closed-door discussion, according to the meeting agenda. The person who allegedly brought the tortillas has not been named by the board. The Coronado Police Department said Monday investigators know who brought the tortillas, and they, too, have declined to identify that person.The Escondido Union High School District held a meeting of its own Tuesday and listened to feedback from community members."The disgusting events that took place over the weekend are not new, but rather a physical manifestation where we have had to endure racist words shouted to us during and after games. However, now there is proof, so the next actions taken will be indicative on how O.G. is valued," one student said.The disgusting events that took place over the weekend are not new, but rather a physical manifestation where we have had to endure racist words shouted to us during and after games.Escondido Union High School District StudentOthers called on the board to stand up for its students, and to put pressure on Coronado school officials to formally label the incident as racist and ensure history doesn't repeat itself.The EUHSD board said it needs more time to gather all the information before taking any action, and said it is in contact with the CIF. The board is set to meet again Thursday to vote on a resolution denouncing racism, racial discrimination, and showing the district's support for equity, safety, and the well-being of students.CAIR, BIPOC Educators Association, San Diego American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), the North County Immigration Task Force (NCITF), and community members took part in the meeting in Escondido. NBC 7's Dave Summers heard from community leaders who want to see those involved held accountable. The Man Who Brought the TortillasOn Wednesday, NBC 7 became aware that a person named Luke Serna had posted on a Coronado Happenings social-media site, claiming responsibility for bringing the tortillas to the game. Serna, who went to Coronado High School himself, posted, in part:" ... the Orange Glen team approached the CHS team on the CHS side of the court with the intent of violence against Islander players, fans and anyone else celebrating the win. As the confrontation continued, several tortillas were thrown up into the air in the direction of the Orange Glen team. There was absolutely no racial intent behind that action. Any effort to claim that was the case is a complete and utter FALSEHOOD."Serna also said in the post that "The tossing of tortillas is used as a celebratory action by the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos at various sporting events including basketball and soccer."People familiar with the practice of tortilla tossing at sporting events, however, say the intent is often to distract during games, not as a celebration after a victory, though a search of the Internet did turn up results describing people throwing tortillas after the Gauchos scored a goal.At a news briefing outside Coronado High School on Tuesday, Enrique Morones of Gente Unida, a coalition of human rights groups, called the tortilla throwing "blatant racism and hate."“We are not against the military, we are not against the white community," Morones said. "But we are against racism, and racism and hate exist in every community.”After reaching Serna via text messaging on Wednesday, he declined to speak to NBC 7 on camera, but he did answer a pair of questions. First, he confirmed he had, in fact, brought the tortillas but said his reasoning had to do with a college tradition.NBC 7"Yes, I brought them to the game and distributed them to one bench player and to CHS cheerleaders to distribute as a celebratory action if the Islanders won, as is done at my alma mater UCSB," Serna texted.Serna also confirmed to NBC 7 that he had been contacted by the Coronado Police Department as part of their investigation."Yes, that is me," Serna texted. "I had one call with the Coronado PD and they injected RACE into the call and said I could be charged with 'Inciting a Riot'. Not the best tactic to take if you're trying to investigate in my opinion."NBC 7Later in the day, Telemundo 20's Tania Luviano was able to contact Serna as well, who told her that he didn’t know the other team was Hispanic and again said he brought the tortillas after the tradition at UC Santa Barbara.The Aftermath of the Tortilla IncidentAs news of the tortilla-throwing incident continues to spread through San Diego County and online this week, four events were planned for Tuesday.The North County Equity & Justice Coalition, Gente Unida and the Racial Justice Coalition of San Diego held a news briefing at noon in front of Coronado High School on Coronado Island.Dozens of parents and supporters and students showed up at the meeting holding signs in support of the Orange Glen community and against the acts at the basketball game. "What happened should not be tolerated," said Mark Mader, the father of an Orange Glen player. "I see a sign back here, 'Strip them of their championship.' No, it's not the championship that needs to be stripped. We have to go directly to the coach and his staff. During the overtime one of the staff members ran across the court and ran right in front of us and tried to start a fight with a lot of the fans, and that is unacceptable, folks." Coronado high school students were seen throwing tortillas at Orange-Glen students after Coronado won the CIF championship basketball game Sunday. NBC 7's Amber Frias reports on what happened. At the briefing, Enrique Morones of Gente Unida, a coalition of human rights groups, called the tortilla throwing "blatant racism and hate." “We are not against the military, we are not against the white community," Morones said. "But we are against racism, and racism and hate exist in every community.”He and his group called for several action items from the Coronado School Board and CIF, including private meetings with the school board, total transparency of their investigations, a public apology and a forfeit of the game. The demands were met with cheers and applause from the crowd of supporters. Several local meetings will be held to discuss what actions should be taken after Coronado High School’s basketball team threw tortillas at their opponents, who come from a predominantly Hispanic school. On top of that, Morones said Coronado schools and other districts should implement diversity training with volunteer organizations that can implement clear guidelines. “We don’t want people to say ‘I didn’t know. I didn’t know that throwing tortillas and yelling racist chants at Latino players was not a celebration.’ C’mon, c’mon," Morones said. "We’re not going to stand for this."Some — who blame the coaching staff for escalating the incident with obscenities before the tortilla-throwing began — are asking for the termination of members of Coronado High School's coaching staff. "I have three boys so I’ve probably been to like 500 games of basketball," said Andres Rivera, the father of an Orange Glen High School basketball player. "[Games] get heated, [Players] go at it during the game but after the game is done, they line up, they shake hands. 100% of the time, always. I have never seen something like what happened here.” Coronado High School's basketball team took the win on Saturday night, but instead of celebrating in good fashion, the team turned their win into what is now being called an act of racism, reports NBC 7's Melissa Adan. The Coronado Unified School Board has not yet addressed allegations against its coaching staff. The Gente Unida coalition planned to have several members in attendance of the Coronado board meeting.What Happened? Coronado Vs. Orange Glen and the Throwing of the TortillasOn the evening of June 19, Coronado High School – a predominantly white high school on Coronado Island in San Diego County – played a CIF championship boys basketball game against Orange Glen High School – a predominantly Latino team from San Diego’s North County.The high-stakes game was action-packed and close.In the end, Coronado beat Orange Glen by 3 points, winning 60-57.‘Really Disrespectful’: Tortillas Thrown at Losing Team in Coronado vs. Escondido CIF Basketball GameBut what came next is what ended up stirring major controversy – and going viral on social media.A still image from the video showing the tortillas being thrown at the basketball game on June 19, 2021.After the final buzzer, before the teams from each side shook hands in a post-game tradition, players from Coronado threw tortillas at the team from Escondido and – according to Orange Glen’s coaches – told them to get out of their gym.“The [Coronado] head coach and the assistant coach came over to our bench and kind of said some words that were inappropriate and told us that we should take our kids and 'get the F out' because we were a bunch of losers,” Lizardo Reynoso, assistant coach for Orange Glen High School, told NBC 7 over the weekend.Then, tortillas were being thrown in our direction. That's beyond disrespect; you're going beyond.Chris Featherly, head coach of Orange Glen High School's boys basketball teamOrange Glen head coach Chris Featherly said after that, he approached the coaches to express how inappropriate he thought the actions of the home team were.“As we approached their bench, not physically, just kind of went over there with our choice of words, let them know how unclassy we felt that was and how disgusting, disrespectful it was to do that,” Featherly explained, “then, tortillas were being thrown in our direction. That’s beyond disrespect; you’re going beyond.”“It’s racist and it was planned,” said Andres Rivera, father of an Orange Glen player.“For it being my last game, I think it was pretty bad,” Orange Glen player Christian Martinez said. “You don't want to go down with an ‘L’ but also the extra stuff like the tortillas and all the smack talking with the coaches. That was really disrespectful.”You don't want to go down with an ‘L’ but also the extra stuff like the tortillas and all the smack talking with the coaches. That was really disrespectful.Christian Martinez, Orange Glen High School basketball playerMore than 80% of the Orange Glen High School student body are Latino. The majority of Coronado High School's student population is white.The Buzz on Social MediaThe tortilla-throwing incident caused a lot of commotion on social media, with many people saying the move was simply mean and uncalled for.In a Twitter post, Coronado head coach J.D. Laaperi wrote, "Unfortunately a community member brought tortillas and distributed them which was unacceptable and racist in nature. I do not condone this behavior Coronado High School does not condone this behavior and is already taking appropriate action."He did not address the allegations leveled against him. Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez tweeted that Coronado High School "should be sanctioned by CIF or stripped of their championship."Bottom line: Coronado High School should be sanctioned by CIF or stripped of their championship. We should have universal condemnation of this activity. Parents in SD County know that racist taunts against latino athletes are too commonplace. It’s time to stop it.— Lorena Gonzalez (@LorenaSGonzalez) June 20, 2021She also tweeted that if this is truly a "teaching moment," there should also be "real consequences" for the teens who are nearly adults."This behavior is unacceptable and reprehensible," Vargas tweeted. "The adults in the room need to do better and teach their kids/athletes better."💯 Agree! @CoronadoUnified has had trouble passing anti discrimination policies, this behavior is unacceptable and reprehensible, the adults in the room need to do better and teach their kids/athletes better. As a community, we me must address this wrong. https://t.co/A0g5MAC0c6— Supervisor Nora Vargas (@SupNoraVargas) June 20, 2021Gonzalez is also part of the Latino Caucus, which called the tortilla-throwing incident an act of hate and called on "the CIF to take strong action to hold the responsible students and school accountable for these hateful, violating acts.”San Diego County Supervisor Nora Vargas also hopped on Twitter to talk about the tortilla incident, responding to Gonzalez's tweet.The Coronado Police Department posted a message on Facebook condemning the incident at the high school basketball game.“We are extremely disturbed by the behavior of some of those attending last night’s basketball game. Their actions are completely unacceptable,” the Coronado Police Department’s Facebook post read, in part. “Coronado Unified School District has promised a full investigation into this incident.”'It Hurts': Outage From the CommunityNews of what happened at the high school basketball game spread through San Diego County over the weekend and this week.Many felt compelled to speak out about the incident, including a 12-year-old Coronado resident who staged a one-woman protest at Coronado High School on Monday."I just came from my physical therapy, but it bothered me enough to go home and make this sign," said the Coronado resident, who only wanted to be identified as Lelea.Her sign read, "Shame on you Coronado HS racist basketball team."Meanwhile, the incident is getting attention from national groups like the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC).LULAC's Vice President of Young Adults Andres Rodriguez said the incident wasn't a heat of the moment exchange. He said it was planned. And it was mean."This took preparation, this took actually getting people together to buy the tortillas, to distribute them, and pretty much in unison throwing them at the Latino players," Rodriguez said.The Coronado Unified School District Governing Board addressed the incident in a letter to the Orange Glen community Monday afternoon, calling the acts "egregious, demeaning and disrespectful.""We fully condemn the racism, classism, and colorism which fueled the actions of the perpetrators and fully support the statement by Superintendent Mueller released earlier this morning. On behalf of the CUSD School Board, we extend a full and formal apology to the Orange Glen High School athletes, known as the Patriots, as well as their peers, parents, teachers, and staff," the statement read, in part.On Sunday, Coronado Unified High School's Superintendent released a statement about the incident. It reads, in part:“Swift action will be taken to address all those involved, and they will be held accountable. it is our hope to create opportunities to dialogue with the orange glen community in an attempt to repair.”CIF also released a statement, reading in part:“The CIF prohibits discrimination or any acts that are disrespectful or demeaning toward a member school, student-athlete, or school community…Upon receipt and review of incident reports from both schools, the CIF will determine the appropriate next steps.”The Sweetwater Union High School District said the act seemed intentional and vowed to take action of its own if it didn't feel Coronado's response was adequate."Should the Coronado Unified School District choose not to adequately address these concerns, the Sweetwater Union High School District will consider actions, such as canceling any future athletic contests against Coronado High School," a statement sent Tuesday read in part.While the investigation is under way, parents, students and coaches hope the Coronado High School basketball team realizes that what they did was unacceptable. NBC 7's Dave Summers heard from community leaders who want to see those involved held accountable. “They’ve worked hard all year, and so has Coronado, and to be overshadowed by some stupidity, it hurts," said Reynoso.Dr. Anne Staffieri, the superintendent of Schools from the Escondido Union High School District, released a message Tuesday about the incident, too, calling the behavior “ugly and unacceptable.”Staffieri said the district has gotten many calls from community groups to facilitate “restorative meetings between the students” and, while she said those meetings are important and “must happen,” the district isn’t ready to have those just yet, as the investigation is ongoing.“We are currently investigating the situation to gather all the facts and understand the sequence of events. After we have the facts and the full picture, it will be appropriate for the students to face one another, to confront, discuss and grow stronger through honest discussions and sincere apologies, and I am confident that both school districts will work to make this happen,” Staffieri’s statement read. Coronado high school students were seen throwing tortillas at Orange-Glen students after Coronado won the CIF championship basketball game Sunday. NBC 7's Amber Frias reports on what happened. “Hard work and perseverance through a pandemic finally had two high school basketball teams facing off in the regional championship game. The student athletes were giving it their all on the court only to have what should have been a celebratory event devolve into an unthinkable experience. It should not have happened, but it did,” she continued. “Now, we must use this focused attention to make a few points clear to our Escondido school community in general and our students, specifically. We do not tolerate behavior that seeks to marginalize, diminish or devalue a person for any reason, including race, religion or gender identity.”Staffieri said groups must work together to look “head-on at divisive behavior, call it out, and work to eliminate it.”She said the Board of Education would discuss a resolution at Tuesday night’s meeting to “denounce racism, racial discrimination, and the district’s support for equity, safety, and well-being of all students.”NBC 7 reached out to Coronado Unified School District regarding the basketball coach and assistant coach's alleged involvement in a verbal exchange before the tortillas were thrown. NBC 7 has not yet heard back from the district about that matter.According to Coronado Police, the male adult who brought the tortillas has been identified but the rest of the incident remains under investigation.The investigation is ongoing; anyone with information can reach out to the Coronado Police Department at (619) 522-7350.

Newsletter SignupHomeTransfer newsTeamsPaper TalkYour SayExclusivesPunditsLive ScoresWin Newsletter Jose Mourinho tears into Luke Shaw and another England man after Czech winDate published: Wednesday 23rd June 2021 7:28 - James Marshment Jose Mourinho has once again waded in on Luke Shaw after claiming the Manchester United full-back and Leeds midfielder Kalvin Phillips contributed to “the only negatives” from England’s win over Czech Republic.Raheem Sterling scored the only goal of the game again at Wembley as the Three Lions secured top spot in Group D. It means they now face a potential last-16 showdown with Portugal, France or Germany. The Manchester City forward headed home a Jack Grealish cross in an impressive first-half performance from Southgate’s men.While their level dropped somewhat in a drab second period, England can at least look forward to another game at Wembley in the knockout stages.After the game, England coach Gareth Southgate was quick to praise Bukayo Saka, who was a deserved Star of the Match.However, Mourinho felt there were two negatives to come from England’s win in Shaw and Phillips.“The only negative thing I would say is they were very poor on attacking corners,” Mourinho told talkSPORT.“The service was dramatically bad. They have so many good players to attack corners.“Luke Shaw, in my opinion, very good tonight but very poor on the corner. Kalvin Phillips, the same.”Mourinho often clashed with Shaw during the Portuguese’s time at Manchester United. In fact, the full-back spoke earlier this year of how that criticism affected his game.Jose Mourinho praises England game managementNew Roma boss Mourinho, however, was impressed with England’s game management and feels they deserved their victory.“It looks good, the players are in good form, Sancho was ready for every second he was on the pitch. The mentality inside is very good,” said Mourinho.“Today they showed two different versions. Great mobility in attack and great creativity. Second half they were a team of position, great positional play and control, you need that in the knockout stage.“People are not over the moon because people are always asking for more and different kind of football, but inside the camp – they will be happy. They will feel they did the job well and they’re ready.“The next one is the one because it will be against a top team. Yes, an advantage because of Wembley, but pressure because it will be a big opponent.“If they go to the quarter-finals, this match could be the one which pushes them all the way.”READ MORE: Mourinho makes Kalvin Phillips selection call that will benefit Jack Grealish ShareKalvin PhillipsLuke ShawJose MourinhoRelated Articles Leeds ace Phillips subject of curious Tottenham claim; admits Liverpool star surpriseLeeds midfielder Kalvin Phillips has become the subject of a strange transfer claim involving Tottenham, and...June 27 2021, 8:23 pm Mourinho makes Kalvin Phillips selection call that will benefit Jack GrealishJose Mourinho has explained why Kalvin Phillips could find himself the unfortunate victim of Gareth Southgate's...June 19 2021, 12:03 pm Mourinho pulls masterstroke as Liverpool, Tottenham suffer transfer blowJose Mourinho's pull as Roma boss looks like it is already paying off, with a Liverpool,...June 17 2021, 2:36 pm Man Utd star reveals ruptured ligament in wrist prior to Euros startingLuke Shaw has revealed he suffered a ruptured ligament in his wrist towards the end of...June 15 2021, 8:27 pm HAVE YOUR SAY IN OUR FORUM Featured Articles Liverpool approach for Kylian Mbappe emerges with Reds duo used as bait Paper Talk: Man City fear major blunder, as Kane transfer truth causes star’s big twist Paper Talk: Liverpool to sign £30m Holland star as Wijnaldum pushes deal Breakthrough for Man Utd as target says yes to move and lays out demands Paratici succeeds where others failed with landmark Tottenham manager ‘agreement’ Our NetworkPlanet FootballFootball365Planet F1Planet RugbyCricket365Tennis365Golf365Love Rugby LeagueRacing365Female FirstContact Music Commercial and SalesYorMedia PartnersOleConnectSky Sports AdvertiseAccessibilityPrivacy and Cookies NoticeTerms & ConditionsContact UsAbout Us

In the early teenage years he was big for his age, physically dominant against the other kids, and some observers questioned whether he relied too much on his speed and strength.The fear was that, when he played against adults and no longer had his physical advantages, Saka might struggle. In hindsight, such concerns can only be described as laughable. Rather than shrinking as he moved up the ranks, and then into the first-team, Saka has adapted and thrived with each leap forward. A constant theme of Saka’s career has been that he becomes better as he is surrounded by better players. It was only when he started to train with the Arsenal senior squad, for example, that he began to display the technical ability and composure that had sometimes been missing in the youth teams.To those who oversaw Saka’s transition from oversized youth prospect into first-team option, and then from first-team option into arguably Arsenal’s most important player, his performance for England on Tuesday night will have come as no surprise. Here was another step up, another test of his ability to adapt, and once again he thrived at a new level.At the age of just 19, Saka demonstrated the same maturity and decision-making ability he has shown on a regular basis in the last two seasons. Arsenal’s player of the year was England’s man of the match against the Czech Republic, doing more than anyone else to drive the team forward and open up the opposition defence.Bukayo Saka's strength and power was on display at WembleyCredit: REUTERSBukayo Saka with his 'Star of the Match' awardCredit: GETTY IMAGESOperating from a right-wing position, Saka showed willingness to drop into central areas and dribble with the ball. It was from such a move that he helped to create Raheem Sterling’s winner, and it was largely Saka’s running from midfield that allowed England to pull the Czech defenders out of position.“That is one of my qualities and is what I have done all season at my club,” he said. “The manager told me to play how I do at my club. Play confident, play free. That’s what I did.”Starting alongside Sterling, Jack Grealish and Harry Kane, Saka looked more than capable of excelling on the international stage. These are better players than he is used to playing with at club level, providing him with more intelligent runs and offering greater technical ability. His combination with Grealish, especially, reflected their shared wavelength on the pitch as well as their burgeoning friendship behind the scenes."It is no surprise to us," said Grealish of Saka's performances. "He has been training brilliantly. He is fearless, he is still young. He is obviously a great, great talent, a great player and also he is actually a lovely, lovely kid as well. He is such a nice, down to earth kid. He is so liked in the changing room by everyone, by the coaching staff. He is just one of those kids you can tell has come from a lovely background. He is a lovely lad and he has got the world at his feet."“We had already qualified so there was no pressure on us,” said Saka. Except for him there evidently was some pressure: this was probably the biggest game of his life, and it was his opportunity to earn a starting place in the team for the knockout rounds.England vs Czech Republic – Euro 2020Whether or not he did enough to keep his spot in Southgate’s lineup remains to be seen. What seems clear, though, is that Southgate is just as enamoured with Saka’s talent and personality as Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager.For Arsenal, and now for England, Saka is the star pupil. The golden child. Sweet, polite, diligent, talented, open-minded: he is all a manager could ever want from a young player. At Arsenal he has played as a left winger, right winger, left wing-back, right wing-back, left-back and central midfielder, doing well in each role. Within the club, there are those who believe Arteta has his favourites. Saka is unquestionably seen as one of them. Indeed, there are some fringe players who are known to cast envious looks at the relationship that Saka has built with his manager, who spent much of last season heaping public praise on his most talented youngster.In recent months it has been striking to see how much power Saka has added to his game. He was always sharp, and was certainly not weak when he first broke through into the Arsenal side, but at first he appeared occasionally lightweight in the Premier League. Now, he appears to be able to breeze past defenders — or shrug them off — and he looked frighteningly quick at times in the first half at Wembley. Saka has been involved with Arsenal since youth-team level, where his size and strength marked him out as a prospectOver the past few days, there had been much discussion about the absence of Jadon Sancho from the England team in the first two games. Less has been said of Saka, who was considered fortunate by some observers to even make the final squad at all. “I have been training, waiting, looking and learning,” Saka said. “I have been waiting for my opportunity. It was only right that I gave my all on the pitch.”One game later, there can be no questioning whether Saka is ahead of Sancho in the pecking order, or whether he deserves to be here. The 19-year-old is making a habit of evolving his game, raising his standards and proving his worth. This latest performance was simply a continuation of a theme that has defined his career so far.Related TopicsEuro 2020,Arsenal FC,England Football TeamTwitter IconFacebook IconWhatsApp IconEmail IconComment speech bubbleThe Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

For a small country our success is phenomenal," he said."We really punch above our weight and for a lead trainer - Jim Bolger - to say that there would be a Lance Armstrong incident in Irish racing is extremely serious."It just can't be ignored it must be dealt with."He added: "In my view he has to either confirm it or withdraw it.

Two teams proficient at 3-point shooting combined to go 9-for-51 from beyond the arc (17.6%) and 34.3% from the field. With the contest tightening after the traditional third-quarter rally by the Clippers, the squads shot a collective 2-for-21 from the field to begin the fourth quarter. According to ESPN Stats & Information, the Clippers attempted 10 go-ahead field goals in the fourth quarter -- and missed all 10.In the end, the Suns outscored the Clippers 15-14 in the final frame, enough to eke out an 84-80 win and a 3-1 series lead as the conference finals return to Phoenix for Monday night's Game 5 (9 p.m. ET on ESPN/ESPN App). In what is one of the most profound franchise turnarounds in recent NBA history, a team that hadn't qualified for the playoffs in more than a decade is now only one game away from the NBA Finals."You put the work in -- that comes in the summertime, that comes through the regular season, the communication, stressing all the details to win," Suns guard Devin Booker said. "I believe in us, believe in this team, our coaching staff, training staff, everybody around this organization. We put the work in. We've put the time in. Now, it's time to let it show."Editor's PicksHow to build a star-powered Olympic team in three steps2dBrian WindhorstNBA playoffs 2021: Matchups, schedules and news for the conference finals3h1 RelatedThe Suns have emerged as one of the most appealing squads on the NBA scene this season. Phoenix is a "fun team" that plays an entertaining brand of basketball: a potent pick-and-roll attack with charismatic guards like Booker and Chris Paul; a bouncy big man coming into his own in Deandre Ayton; a platoon of young perimeter snipers who move well off the ball, including Mikal Bridges and Cameron Johnson; and an emotional stopper in Jae Crowder.Very little of that charm was on display Saturday night. Phoenix's 84 points were the fewest of any winning team this season, according to ESPN Stats & Info. After the first quarter, the Suns struggled to generate quality looks in the half court and convert the open ones they found. For the third consecutive game in the series, Booker toiled from the field and ultimately fouled out late in the fourth quarter. The Suns shot 24.4% in the second half -- the second-worst field goal percentage in the second half of a playoff win over the past 25 postseasons -- and somehow managed to win a professional basketball game.Despite the ugly play -- or perhaps because of it -- the win was particularly impressive. Any NBA team playing this deep into the postseason has the pyrotechnics needed to put on an offensive exhibition. The true contenders? They summon the resourcefulness to win when they're playing awful basketball. The Game 4 win in Los Angeles revealed a team with a mastery of the margins, a quality Booker said flows down from Suns coach Monty Williams."Monty's so detail-oriented," Booker said. "You have to be like that, understanding little plays and understanding what people like to do, make or break a game.Case in point: The Clippers feature one of the switchiest defensive schemes in the NBA, one that has served them well both in the regular season and playoffs. Their mobility has enabled them to stay in front of Phoenix's perimeter attackers for much of the series. But no NBA defense is foolproof, and each presents a vulnerability that can be exploited. Even as the Clippers made life difficult on Paul and Booker as they drove, the guards found just enough daylight to draw a contest from Clippers center Ivica Zubac. That's when Ayton slipped deep into the paint and readied himself to crash the offensive glass and collect many of the Suns' numerous misses."If you're going to miss that much, you hope to get some of them back," Williams said. "[Ayton's] ability to keep balls in play without going over the back -- he's one of the best I've ever seen getting up in the air and reaching over for tip-ins to himself."West finals on ESPN and ABCABC and ESPN are your home for the 2021 Western Conference finals, as the Phoenix Suns face the LA Clippers for a trip to the NBA Finals.Game 5: June 28, 9 p.m. ET on ESPNGame 6*: June 30, 9 p.m. ET on ESPNGame 7*: July 2, 9 p.m. ET on ESPN*If necessaryOn a night when virtually nobody posted a pretty line in the box score, Ayton was a paragon of efficiency. He scored 19 points, collected 22 rebounds (nine of them on the offensive end) and blocked four shots. Appropriately, he and Paul connected to end the Suns' fourth-quarter drought with an alley-oop off a pick-and-roll. That action with that pairing was one of the Suns' only productive pieces of offense.Ayton continues to enjoy a breakout season, one that saw him gain fluency in back-line defense as well as the pick-and-roll -- both essential tasks any aspiring All-Star big man must master. After the game, Ayton credited Paul for much of that growth, noting that the 16-year veteran was "the only guy that's ever pushed me, like big bro pushed me." A master of detail like his coach, Paul schooled Ayton in the dark arts of the pick-and-roll. Mechanics and nuance don't make for good highlight footage, but they're precisely those kinds of elements that empower a team on a poor shooting night to prevail."It started at training camp," Ayton said of his graduate-level education under Paul. "The first thing he told me that was going to keep me in the league for a long time was angles. And I was like, 'Angles?'"Angles, indeed. Because for every playoff win that's the result of a dynamic scorer dropping 45 on a night he is unguardable, there are two there for the taking for the team that wins the margins. In one season, Ayton has demonstrated the reliability and smarts befitting of a No. 1 overall pick. In that spirit, Paul commented that for such a young roster, the Suns are uncommonly mature."We've got a young team, but with some old souls," Paul said.Not that there isn't a healthy supply of youthful whimsy. Following Saturday's game, Ayton showed up at his news conference wearing a black T-shirt featuring a massive floating head of Booker with his nose broken. Ayton explained that the shirt, designed by a friend, told the world that the Suns can take a punch in the face.Booker, whom Paul referred to as the oldest 24-year-old in the world, was a bit more sober. Asked about whether he allowed himself to think about the Suns' proximity to the NBA Finals, Booker was measured, if candid."We know what's on the table," Booker said. "We know what's there."FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmailTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementDo Not Sell My InfoContact UsDisney Ad Sales SiteCopyright: © ESPN Enterprises, Inc.

The last time they lost was on September 10th, 2018, when Portugal beat them in the inaugural UEFA Nations League.Italy's current run is now the joint-third longest on the international stage and they're just four matches behind the record holders, per Goal.The nine longest unbeaten runs in international footballFrance (2010-2012) - 23 matchesWest Germany (1978-1981) - 23 matchesAlgeria (2018-present) - 27 matchesFrance (1994-1996) - 30 matchesItaly (1935-1939) - 30 matchesArgentina (1991-1993) - 31 matchesItaly (2018-present) - 31 matchesSpain (2007-2009) - 35 matchesBrazil (1993-1996) - 35 matchesSo Italy are just four games away from equalling Spain and Brazil's incredible 35-match unbeaten runs.That means the Azzurri would have to win Euro 2020 this summer and then avoid defeat in their first match after the triumph.It's certainly a tall order for Mancini's side, but there's no denying that they have the quality and team spirit required to earn the right to lift the coveted trophy on July 11th at Wembley.They will have to do it the hard way, though.As we previously mentioned, Italy will play either Belgium or Portugal in the quarter-finals of Euro 2020 and if they win that, a date with France or Spain in the semi-finals is very likely.1 of 20Who is this scoring a penalty for Italy against Joe Hart?

After Chad Wingard chipped a kick to the top of the goal square, O’Brien flew over Jack Buckley with his right shin then pushed off the 194cm defender’s shoulder to gain a second lift and send him even higher. The 27-year-old held onto the ball all the way down, then went back to kick a goal and put his team in the lead.

Whitfield flushed the left-foot barrel on the run so well that the Hawks’ midfielder panicked and gave away a free kick to Greene, who kicked the goal and reduced the margin to three points.

But Denver Grainger-Barras was closer to goal when he gave an early glimpse of his talents, as he soared over a pack and threw in a twist to claim the ball in the air just outside the forward 50 arc. The 195cm defender’s day ended early when he later copped a knock to the head, but by then the 19-year-old had gathered seven disposals and four marks to show he’ll be more than comfortable at the top level.Debutant Denver Grainger-Barras and 399-gamer Shaun Burgoyne walk off the MCG.

Those who watched his performance would be hard-pressed to disagree. Davis (25-0, 24 KOs), a 26-year-old rising star, headlined his second consecutive PPV card and added a world title in a third weight class by stopping Mario Barrios (26-1, 17 KOs), the WBA regular champion at 140 pounds, in Round 11 of a thrilling and dramatic slugfest inside State Farm Arena. Although Davis was leading on all three scorecards at the time of the stoppage, Barrios was busier and largely fighting him on what appeared to be even terms throughout a series of competitive and exciting rounds to close the fight. Davis, a native of Baltimore, rallied in Round 11 after a hot start from Barrios to floor him for the third time in the fight with a left uppercut to the body. After Barrios made it back to his feet, a flurry from Davis along the ropes forced referee Thomas Taylor to jump in at 2:13 of the round. "I made it tough, I made it tough. I definitely could have made it easier but it is what it is," Davis said. "I went up two weight classes and I got the job done." The reigning 130-pound WBA champion and secondary WBA titleholder at 135 pounds, Davis proved to be the bigger puncher despite giving up nearly six inches in height in his junior welterweight debut, just nine months after recording the knockout of the year in 2020 by finishing Leo Santa Cruz with an uppercut in Round 6 of their junior lightweight bout.Can't get enough boxing and MMA?

Subscribe to Morning Kombat with Luke Thomas and Brian Campbell for the best analysis and in-depth news, including instant analysis of Tank Davis' thrilling knockout of Mario Barrios below."It was just adjustments. He is 140 [pounds] and I wanted to catch him with clean shots," Davis said. "I don't just want to throw any type of shot. At first I was missing them but eventually I caught up to him. "I was coming up two weight classes but I knew that if I caught him, I could get him out of there." After a strong start from Barrios by using his jab to control distance without over extending himself to be countered, the diminutive Davis made the most important adjustment of the fight in Round 5 when he began to parry at Barrios' jab with his right glove. The change disarmed Barrios of the shot as he became worried that the quicker Davis would counter him in close. "I have never been a hater, congrats to Tank. He came in here and did his thing," Barrios said. "This was nothing short of an exciting fight and that's what we came here to do. I'll be back." Davis appeared as if he seized momentum for good in Round 8 when a lead right hook surprised Barrios and dropped him hard. Davis followed up to force a second knockdown with the left hand but spent the final two minutes of the round unsuccessfully trying to finish the tough Barrios, which left his gas tank low. Barrios appeared to hurt Davis with a left hand in Round 9. By the following round, the two fighters routinely traded big shots in the center of the ring as the action only increased. What made the theater of watching the fight more interesting was that Floyd Mayweather, the promoter and mentor of Davis, twice approached him in the corner between rounds late in the fight to tell Davis he was potentially down on the scorecards in a close fight. "I knew [Barrios] was hurt. I just had to catch him at the right time," Davis said. "Floyd came to me and was honest, he told me I was down. He said, 'Show me that you are great.' This man set the tone, I'm just following in his footsteps. Floyd, I appreciate you. I'm thankful to be in this position." Each time Barrios had big moments as the fight moved into the championship rounds, Davis was able to rally even bigger down the stretch to stun him with a big shot leading up to the stoppage. "My coach was telling me to go to a jab side but me, I'm southpaw, so I faked like I was going left and threw my hook over the top, that's how I caught him," Davis said. Davis outlanded Barrios by a margin of 96-93, according to CompuBox. Both fighters landed 17 body shots in total, but it was Barrios who used a steady attack of them late to help slow Davis down. Elsewhere on the card, Erickson Lubin may have secured his rematch with Jermell Charlo by stopping Jeison Rosario with a sixth-round TKO in the co-main event. Lubin, a former junior middleweight title challenger, broke Rosario down to the body before landing the seminal blow to the head and dropping Rosario. A follow-up punch appeared to land with Rosario on the ground, but the referee still called off the fight with Rosario writhing in agony from the body blow. It was the second straight defeat by body shot TKO suffered by Rosario, who was also stopped by Charlo in the same fashion last September.CBS Sports was with you throughout the entire way on Saturday, so be sure to follow along with the live results and highlights below.

Photo / GettyBy: Christopher Reive Christopher Reive is a sports reporter for NZME@chrisreiveA bloodied Ruby Tui was forced from the field during the Black Ferns Sevens' match against Fiji in Townsville on Sunday afternoon, copping a stray knee to the head in the 27-12 win.Tui was making a tackle after the restart following a Portia Woodman try, and was kneed by an opposition player coming in to form the ruck as she rolled away. Tui clutched her head straight away, and remained on the ground for a few moments while play continued, before getting back into the defensive line.It didn't prevent her from making a tackle and trying to win a turnover at the ruck, but play was soon stopped, however, as the referee called for a replacement due to blood running down Tui's face.Tough day in the office for @rubytui 🤕Don’t worry fam, she’s all good!#Oceania7s pic.twitter.com/xhHVuTgWUq— Black Ferns (@BlackFerns) June 27, 2021Tui needed seven stitches for the wound on her forehead, but said she was fine in a post on Instagram.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME."Just another day in the office, one game down one more to go today with plenty of action. Thanks for all the messages, especially the Harry Potter ones, but don't worry your girl is all good, still here & still living a dream," Tui said.The Black Ferns Sevens have been firing on all cylinders during the warm-up tournament against Australia, Fiji and an Oceania invitational team ahead of the Tokyo Olympics in July, as they look to go one better than their performance at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro where they finished second.The tournament in Townsville is the final opportunity for the players to stake their claim to a spot in the final squad for the Olympics. Currently, there are 21 players with the squad, however Olympic teams are whittled down to just 16 – 13 first-choice players and three travelling reserves.The All Blacks Sevens are also in Townsville, with a men's tournament running alongside the womens'. Both teams have to nominate their 16-strong teams for Tokyo by Tuesday, making this weekend's tournament the final chance for players to earn their spots.Related articlesSport|RugbyPhil Gifford: Eight things you (probably) didn't know about All Blacks captain26 Jun, 2021 11:05 PMQuick ReadSport|RugbyMāori All Blacks triumph in test return26 Jun, 2021 09:10 AMQuick ReadSport|RugbyWhat midfield crisis means for All Blacks opener26 Jun, 2021 12:00 AMQuick ReadSport|RugbyGregor Paul: The 'mad' All Blacks idea that could be a masterstroke25 Jun, 2021 07:30 PMQuick Read AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from SportSport|Rugby'We addressed the elephant in the room': Mo'unga can't ignore Barrett battle28 Jun, 2021 04:00 AM3 minutes to readPremiumSportHow Warriors' surprise recruit could help late season revival28 Jun, 2021 03:30 AM4 minutes to readSportState of Origin star told to shut it after sad interview28 Jun, 2021 02:34 AM5 minutes to readSportWatch: Gone-rad!

Conor Murray looms as Warren Gatland's greatest captaincy gambleTony Smith17:10, Jun 27 2021SKY SPORTHalfback Conor Murray, who scored against the All Blacks in 2017, will captain the Lions in South Africa in 2021.OPINION: Cool-hand Kiwi coach Warren Gatland has plucked an unexpected card from his red blazer sleeve by naming Ireland halfback Conor Murray as the British and Irish Lions’ new captain. But will it prove an ace? Or a joker? Gatland has surely taken the biggest gamble of his coaching career in appointing Murray – who has reportedly never captained Munster or Ireland - to replace original skipper Alun Wyn Jones, who dislocated a shoulder against Japan on Saturday (Sunday NZ time). For the first time since taking over the Lions in 2013, Gatland will have a leader without a proven captaincy CV.David Rogers/Getty ImagesCoach Warren Gatland (R) and halfback Conor Murray on the British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand in 2017. Murray has been named to captain the Lions in South Africa in 2021.

Gatland has plumped for Murray – on his third Lions tour – ahead of regular international captains, England's Owen Farrell and Scotland's Stuart Hogg. Other options included Scarlets club captain and Jones' Wales lieutenant Ken Owens, and lock Maro Itoje (often touted as an England captain in waiting).Ian MacNicol/Getty ImagesConor Murray of the Lions is tackled by Amanaki Lelei Mafi of Japan at Murrayfield on Saturday. Gatland's punt has been interpreted by British and Irish rugby media as a sign Murray is one of the few Lions players guaranteed test selection, despite Itoje being rated, arguably, as the world’s best lock. Gavin Mairs, writing in The Daily Telegraph, said for all Murray's gifts and experience as a player, "that he would ascend to the captaincy ... still comes as an enormous surprise''. “So what this selection suggests is that Murray is one of relatively few players who is almost certain of a place in Gatland's side to face the Springboks. To select a captain but not pick him would be a difficulty the head coach cannot envisage.” Alex Spink, writing in The Daily Mirror, described Murray as a "totally leftfield selection'' and even the Irish Independent claimed, in a headline, that the Munster man (who has 89 Ireland caps and another five for the Lions) was "a shock choice'' as skipper. The 42, Ireland's specialist sports website, however, claimed it was "a sensational decision'' and a “remarkable reward'' for Murray, which “underlies his sheer importance to Gatland''. In naming Murray – his first-choice halfback in New Zealand – Gatland said: “Conor is an outstanding rugby player and is held in the highest regard with both the players and coaches”. “As a three-time Lions tourist, he knows what will be required as captain, and I am certain he will lead the squad with excellence. He will also be well-supported by an experienced leadership group.”Getty-ImagesSam Warburton (left) repaid Warren Gatland’s faith in him as a young captain for Wales and the Lions. Despite his success in Europe with Wasps and Wales, Gatland has copped flak for his conservative "Warrenball'' style of rugby, but the former All Blacks hooker has been known to pull off a calculated captaincy gamble. Cardiff flanker Sam Warburton was just 22 when Gatland named him Wales' second-youngest captain in 2011. To add to the pressure, the only younger player to lead Wales was halfback Gareth Edwards, arguably their greatest ever. Yet, Warburton went on to lead Wales with distinction at two Rugby World Cup tournaments. He was also Gatland's automatic choice as Lions captain for the 2013 tour to Australia, despite the presence of more experienced leaders, including Ireland's Brian O'Driscoll and Paul O'Connell. The Lions won that series and in 2017, drew a series with the All Blacks still on Warburton's watch. Murray, who made his Ireland debut in 2011, will not enjoy as lengthy a tenure, but Gatland will be hoping he has the same instant impact.most popularCovid-19 NZ live: Cabinet has commissed advice around potentially making QR scanning compulsory, Ardern saysSurprise!

He is valued at €55m by Transfermarkt, which could be a fair value for his potential.United are loaded with defensive midfield options. They have Scott McTominay, Fred, Nemanja Matic, Paul Pogba and James Garner.Garner appears set to be loaned out again while there is uncertainty over Pogba’s future with his contract expiring in June next year.Matic may also be phased out soon. Camavinga could be tempted to join United if he has the assurance of regular game time.United, Arsenal and Madrid could yet miss out on his services, with reports suggesting that he has the preference to stay in Ligue 1 with Paris Saint-Germain.Stats from Transfermarkt.comRead: Everton in talks to sign Sergio Romero.

He broke Nakatani down from the opening bell and eventually score a knockdown in the fifth. Lomachenko continued his onslaught in the later rounds and lined up for the finish in the ninth. Nakatani was busted up and tired so his chances were slim. “Matrix” would find a home for a beautifully combination that toppled Nakatani and forced the referee’s hand.Check out the video highlights below:Down goes Nakatani Lomachenko scores the first knockdown of the fight in Round 5. #LomaNakatani pic.twitter.com/l33JPXts4T— ESPN Ringside (@ESPNRingside) June 27, 2021Snapped his head back #LomaNakatani pic.twitter.com/cxK1SabCkq— ESPN Ringside (@ESPNRingside) June 27, 2021VICIOUS TKO @VasylLomachenko is back! #LomaNakatani pic.twitter.com/asVYl0Sl2Z— ESPN Ringside (@ESPNRingside) June 27, 2021Get the latest gearNate Diaz ‘I’m Not Surprised’ T-ShirtUFC 263 Autographed Event PosterUFC 263 Event T-ShirtUFC 263 Artist Series Event T-ShirtIsrael Adesanya Paint Burst T-ShirtTUF Coaches Alexander Volkanovski JerseyTUF Coaches Brian Ortega Jersey More From MMAmania.comBrawl Leads To MMA Match At R3 Fighting Championship In MoscowJaynes Reacts To Losing $25k Bet On Himself At UFC Vegas 30Matches To Make After UFC Vegas 30 Barnett, JDS, And Overeem Amongst Potential Opponents For Fedor’s ReturnCiryl Gane ‘Really Comfortable’ With Idea Of Fighting Former Teammate NgannouVideo: Paul Begs For Mercy During Mayweather Fight Most Read Video: Paul Begs For Mercy During Mayweather FightIf "Money" was taking it easy on Logan Paul during their exhibition, Paul certainly didn’t seem to realize it at the time.BKFC 18 Highlights!

"All the strategies that we developed with my team [worked]. I reached all my goals. I won, and now I'm back on track."Vasiliy Lomachenko outlanded Masayoshi Nakatani 104-29, including an 89-26 edge in power punches. Al Powers / ESPN ImagesThe finish came at 1 minute, 48 seconds of the ninth, as referee Celestino Ruiz intervened during a prolonged flurry in the middle of the ring.Nakatani, who survived an earlier knockdown in the fifth, was essentially out on his feet. He attempted to tie Lomachenko up to stop the barrage, but Lomachenko consistently created space and landed at will.With the victory, Lomachenko earned the right to a potential rematch with Lopez (16-0, 12 KOs), a reward he has made no secret he desperately seeks. Lomachenko lost a unanimous decision to Lopez in October, but said he felt it should have been scored a draw. He has also claimed he was negatively impacted by an injury to his right shoulder.Punch StatsPunchesLomachenkoNakataniTotal landed10429Total thrown214250Percent49%12%Jabs landed153Jabs thrown62112Percent24%3%Power landed8926Power thrown152138Percent59%19%-- Courtesy of CompuBoxLopez's father, Teofimo Sr., was in attendance on Saturday. He approached Lomachenko's corner immediately after the bout and was quickly escorted away by security. Lopez, 23, was scheduled to face George Kambosos Jr. on June 5, but the bout was moved to Aug. 14 after Lopez tested positive for COVID-19. The bout could be postponed further, depending on how Lopez recovers."He has a fight in the future with Kambosos, but after [we will fight]," Lomachenko said. "Maybe next year, beginning of the year. December, January, February. I am waiting."Lomachenko added: "Everybody saw how I won this fight, and everybody is waiting for the rematch [with Lopez], so let's make a rematch."Editor's PicksLomachenko's statement win lines him up for shot at redemption against Teofimo Lopez1dBrett OkamotoVasiliy Lomachenko demolishes Masayoshi Nakatani, Gervonta Davis wins another title23hBrett Okamoto and Michael Rothstein1 RelatedLater Saturday, Lopez Sr. told ESPN that Lopez's camp is willing to grant Lomachenko a rematch, something Lopez hadn't expressed interest in previously."After this performance, I think the public wants to see this fight," Lopez Sr. said. "And I could convince my son to fight him again."Regardless of the true extent of Lomachenko's injury the first time he fought Lopez, he was undeniably a different fighter in front of a sellout crowd of 2,072 on Saturday. Lomachenko, 33, was aggressive from the opening bell. His defense was impeccable, and he consistently worked to the inside of the much taller and rangier Nakatani.Really, the only adversity Lomachenko faced came in the first round, when he suffered a cut following an accidental head-butt. The cut continued to bleed throughout the fight, but it did little to slow Lomachenko. His lead left hand caused Nakatani fits, and he seemed unbothered by his opponent's physicality in the clinch.The knockdown occurred in the final seconds of the fifth round, courtesy of a left hand. Lomachenko landed a short left as Nakatani tried to tie him up and followed that with a lightning-quick right hand from a short distance.In addition to dominating a worthy opponent, Lomachenko made a statement by finishing Nakatani, something Lopez failed to do when he fought him in July 2019. Lopez won that fight in a convincing decision, although the fight was competitive. Lomachenko said before Saturday that was the main reason he chose Nakatani as an opponent."In case there was any doubt, Lomachenko proved he is still one of the very best fighters in the world," Bob Arum, Lomachenko's promoter at Top Rank, said after Saturday's fight. "He is healthy and ready to fight any of the lightweights."FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmailTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementDo Not Sell My InfoContact UsDisney Ad Sales SiteCopyright: © ESPN Enterprises, Inc.

Despite finishing last season on an agonising low with Europa League final defeat to Villarreal the Norwegian remains popular amongst the key decision-makers at Old Trafford, even if some supporters remain unconvinced. Manchester United insist they made 'progress' under Solskjaer last season even if they don't have any silverware to show for it, but a second-place finish in the Premier League is an undeniable step forward from ending the season third a year ago. This summer United will need to put their money where their mouth is when it comes to supporting Solskjaer in the summer transfer window; an imminent move for Jadon Sancho is certainly one step in the right direction. Read MoreRelated ArticlesManchester United player sales could determine next transfer after Jadon Sancho Read MoreRelated ArticlesPortugal might be doing Manchester United a favour with Bruno Fernandes during Euro 2020 Next up will be the priority addition of a new centre-back as United look to secure a long-term partner for Harry Maguire, an addition which they hope will alter their fortunes in the same manner Virgil van Dijk and Ruben Dias did to their two most fierce rivals. In an ideal world United will end the summer window with world-class additions up front and in defence, while there could also be bolstered options at full-back and midfield depending on the opportunities which might arise. Those aforementioned additions could well be enough to transform United into serious Premier League title challengers next season, the issue for Solskjaer is that with such backing it would have to be the minimum. "You can’t say that is an achievement," Solskjaer told reporters when asked about the merits of finishing second this season. "Our ambition is a lot more than second place. I said that when I wasn’t at the club – you can never be happy with that and we’re not. "Don’t get me wrong, our ambition is to catch the team in front of us." Significant investment this summer would be evidence of United's ambition to target a top-flight title rather than just the lucrative comfort of a top-four finish and Champions League qualification, but by spending so much the pressure will only be increased on Solskjaer to deliver. While there was evidence of progress last season the caveat is that Man City were still comfortable title winners, while the demise of Liverpool was more down to injuries rather than being at the end of their cycle under Jurgen Klopp. The ambition might be for United to catch the team in front of them last season but there is also a pressing case to suggest Chelsea might actually be the team to beat over the next year, while the likes of Tottenham and Leicester remain potential wildcards should things go their way. It means United's challenge of winning the title does not rely simply on trying to overtake City, it also relies on holding off the fierce challenge from the sides which finished below them. In order to have any chance of winning the Premier League next season it is clear United need to spend big this summer, but failure to fulfil such ambition could end up costing Solskjaer even more.

Anastasiya Dudkina 25 Jun 202122:21ForecastsEURO-2020 All time statistics: 0 0 0 StatisticsOddsBet TypeBookmakerClaim Bonus!Odds2.28Bet TypeW1 and handicap (-1)Bookmaker Bonus 100 USD Bet Now!The Netherlands got out of the group stage with no problem, clinching three wins in three games. Next up is the encounter with the Czech Republic. Will the Czechs create a sensation, or will Frank de Boer’s side overpower the underdogs? We are opting for the latter. Below are our arguments.NetherlandsFrank de Boer’s side was successful in their mission to qualify from first place in the group, without conceding a single point. The overall score was 8-2 in favour of the Dutch. Two goals were conceded from Ukraine in the second half, making the score 2-2. But the Oranje found the strength to pull out a win when it looked lost. So, as we can see, there’s nothing wrong with the Dutch mentality. Denzel Dumfries, Georginio Wijnaldum and even Memphis Depay are all outstanding, making the Dutch several times more dangerous as this team carries several threats at once.Czech RepublicThe Czech Republic managed to qualify for the play-offs from third place with the same number of points as Croatia, who drew 1-1. The most important match was the first against the Scots at Hampden Park, who will long remember the name of Patrik Schick, who scored two goals to set up the final score at 2-0. One of these goals came from the centre of the pitch, for which they were quick to acclaim as the most beautiful goal of this Euro. Well, nothing new happened to the England team. The English scored a quick goal and played on defence in the second half, without committing a single shot. Croatia finished second because of a better goal difference than the Czech team. And the Czechs qualified from the group thanks to their four points.Expert Betting TipsWe believe that the Czechs’ tournament journey is over because the Dutch are a difficult opponent. There’s a big gap between them and we expect to see it reflected on the scoreboard in Budapest. Thus, our prediction for the match is a win for the Oranje with a handicap (-1) for 2.28.We also believe that their head-to-head encounter will be traditionally productive and open. In this regard, we’d like to bet on Total Over 2.5 goals for 1.90.Georginio Wijnaldum is having a very strong tournament, scoring three goals. Therefore, it makes sense to bet on his goal for 4.74.OddsBet TypeBookmakerClaim Bonus!Odds2.28Bet TypeW1 and handicap (-1)Bookmaker Bonus 100 USD Bet Now!Odds1.90Bet TypeTotal Over 2.5 goalsBookmaker Bonus 30 EUR Bet Now!Odds4.74Bet TypeGeorginio Wijnaldum to scoreBookmaker Bonus 110 USD Bet Now!Tags: Netherlands Czech Republic EURO Rating:0 Share Other predictions O: 1.84 28 Jun 202119:00 Croatia vs Spain: The Croats will cause La Roja a lot of problems Anastasiya Dudkina EURO-202012:57:36 O: 1.57 28 Jun 202122:00 France vs Switzerland: an easy match for France Edgar Toro EURO-202015:57:36 O: 3.30 29 Jun 202119:00 England vs Germany: A legendary match Edgar Toro EURO-202036:57:36 O: 2.40 29 Jun 202122:00 Sweden vs Ukraine: Betting on the victory of Sweden Edgar Toro EURO-202039:57:36 O: 9.0 10 Jul 202100:00 Tips and Odds for EURO 2020: Kylian Mbappe to be the Top Goalscorer Edgar Toro Europa League281:57:36 O: 11.0 11 Jul 202100:00 EURO 2020 Prediction: betting on non-obvious outcomes in Group F - The group of death Edgar Toro Football305:57:36 O: 7.1 11 Jul 202121:00 EURO 2020 Betting Tips & Odds: The Belgians will reach the trophy Anastasiya Dudkina Football326:57:36 O: 10.00 11 Jul 202121:00 EURO 2020 Betting Tips & Odds: Italy will keep collecting clean sheets Anastasiya Dudkina Football326:57:36 O: 1.77 27 Jun 202122:00 Belgium vs Portugal: Belgians to win in an exciting encounter Anastasiya Dudkina EURO-2020Finished O: 1.83 26 Jun 202122:00 Italy vs Austria: The Italians’ warm-up before a tough match Anastasiya Dudkina EURO-2020Finished O: 1.92 26 Jun 202119:00 Wales vs Denmark: Vikings can reach the Euro 2020 quarter-finals Anastasiya Dudkina EURO-2020Finished O: 2.29 23 Jun 202122:00 Portugal vs France: Reigning European champions risk missing the playoffs Anastasiya Dudkina EURO-2020Finished O: 1.90 23 Jun 202122:00 Germany vs Hungary: The German side are confident of beating the Hungarians Anastasiya Dudkina EURO-2020Finished O: 6.95 23 Jun 202119:00 Slovakia vs Spain: Very low odds for a Spanish win Anastasiya Dudkina EURO-2020Finished O: 3.56 23 Jun 202119:00 Sweden vs Poland: Will the first draw between the Swedes and Poles take place?

SunsLiveTodayTomorrowvs-|The Clippers had nothing against the Suns defense. (Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)It wasn't pretty, but the Phoenix Suns are one game away from the NBA Finals.The Suns defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 84-80 in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals on Saturday to take a commanding 3-1 series lead.The series hasn't exactly been a highlight reel overall, but the ugliness reached another level in Game 4, with both teams posting their lowest scoring output of the playoffs. The Clippers entered halftime down 50-36 thanks to a stifling Suns defense, but made it a game by outscoring Phoenix by 11 points in the third quarter.The comeback continued into the fourth quarter, with the Clippers pushing the lead to one point at 71-70. And then, well, the team stopped scoring. It would make only one more field goal until the final minute, spending more than half the quarter down just one point. The Suns weren't much better, but they at least managed to score like a barely functioning NBA team.The Clippers still had a chance in the final minute, but old friend Chris Paul prevented a comeback by making 5-of-6 free throws with the seconds ticking down.Deandre Ayton posts 19 points, 22 reboundsDevin Booker led the Suns in scoring with 25 points until he fouled out, but Deandre Ayton was the star of the show for Phoenix. The center dominated the paint, totaling 19 points, 22 rebounds and four blocks.The Clippers, down their starting center in Serge Ibaka, just didn't have an answer for him:This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The series now heads back to Phoenix with the Clippers staring down a 3-1 series deficit. Erasing that lead isn't impossible (see: the Clippers' postseason last year), but it's the most dire position the Clippers have found themselves in a playoff run defined by comebacks.Kawhi Leonard remains out with an ACL injury, and it's unclear if he'll be able to make it back during the playoffs at all. The Clippers are probably going to need to do this with what they currently have, and that won't be easy against a Phoenix team that has arguably been the most impressive team of the playoffs.Story continuesStill, if we've learned anything these NBA playoffs, it's that no one throws a counterpunch like the Clippers. Game 5 is scheduled for 6 p.m. PT on Monday.More from Yahoo Sports:Lakers minority owner will reportedly sell stake in teamGoodwill: The Bucks finally look like themselves in Game 2Trail Blazers reportedly hire Chauncey BillupsJenkins: Don't take Kevin Durant for grantedTRENDING 1.

Cody Bellinger came off the bench and hit a walk-off homer run against Cubs righty Keegan Thompson on Saturday to give the Dodgers back-to-back wins following a four-game losing streak (LAD 3, CHC 2).Here is the game-winning homer. Bellinger was not in Saturday's starting lineup, but he entered the game as part of a double switch in the seventh inning. He flied out to center in his first at-bat before launching the walk-off homer next time up."It's good to see him smile," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters, including MLB.com's Sarah Wexler, following Saturday's game. Bellinger went into Saturday's game hitting only .217/.349/.304 with one home run in 19 games around injuries this season.Saturday's game was not without controversy. In the seventh inning, Jason Heyward hit what appeared to be -- and what was initially called -- a go-ahead solo home run off righty Phil Bickford. The ball snuck just inside the left field foul pole. Here's the video:The Dodgers challenged the home run call and, after review, it was overturned and ruled a foul ball. I didn't see indisputable evidence that the ball sailed foul, though the replay center has access to camera angles that aren't shown on the broadcast, so perhaps they saw something more definitive. I would assume so seeing how the call was overturned.Anyway, the call was overturned and the at-bat continued. Heyward singled to center following the non-homer, though he was quickly erased on a double play. The score remained 2-2 and the stage was set for Bellinger to win the game."It's hard to see from my vantage point, but it looked like a home run," Cubs manager David Ross told reporters, including the Chicago Tribune's Meghan Montemurro, following the game. "(Third base umpire D.J. Reyburn) called it a home run. They got together and conversed and I guess they overturned it ... I got a boundaries call. All we can do at that point is trust in the video." The Dodgers and Cubs wrap up their four-game weekend series Sunday afternoon. Veteran righty Clayton Kershaw and neophyte righty Adbert Alzolay are the scheduled starting pitchers.

PH golfer Dottie Ardina surges to solo 6th in women's PGA 3rd roundJun 27, 2021 11:37 AM PHTBeatrice GoFilipina golfer Dottie Ardina stayed within reach of LPGA major title hopes with a solo sixth standing on Saturday, June 26 (Sunday, June 27, Manila time) after three rounds in the KPMG Women's PGA Championship in Johns Creek, Georgia, USA. Ardina, who was tied for 10th in the first half of the tournament, went bogey-free in the third round to record a 68 and sit 8-under-68 after 54 holes. She birdied holes No. 2, 13, 14, and 17 to stay seven strokes away from tournament leaders Lizette Salas and Nelly Korda. Salas, the first-round leader, fired a 5-under-67 on Saturday to catch second-round leader Nelly Korda and secure a share of the lead. Salas torched the front nine in 30, including a dazzling stretch of six birdies in the first eight holes, to finish the third round with her third consecutive 67. That matched the 54-hole score for Korda, who followed Friday's 63 with a strong 68 as both golfers sit at 15-under-201.US Women's Open champion Yuka Saso continued to struggle in the major after firing a 75 in the third round and is tied at 42nd with other LPGA stars Michelle Wie West, Lydia Ko, and Lauren Stephenson. Bianca Pagdanganan, who broke into the LPGA scene in last year's Women's PGA championship with a ninth place finish, failed to make the cut into the final rounds. After the tournament, the women's Olympic golf list will be decided based on world rankings, where Saso and Pagdanganan are expected to make the cut. – Rappler.comBeatrice Go@beebeego09More commonly known as “Bee”, Beatrice is a multimedia sports reporter for Rappler, who covers Phillippine sports governance, national teams, football and the UAAP.

The reigning Asian Games champion and World Championships silver-medallist is the only Indian boxer from the nine Tokyo-bound men and women pugilists to have received the top billing by the BTF. The news will definitely spur Panghal to Olympic glory as the No. 1 ranking has come just 27 days ahead of the start of the boxing competitions (July 24-August 8) at the Tokyo Games. The 25-year-old Rohtak boy’s nearest rival and his nemesis of late, Uzbekistan’s Shakhobidin Zoirov, has been ranked fifth in the world. The other three boxers in top-five of the 52kg category include France’s Billal Bennama (World No. 2), Algeria’s Mohamed Flissi (No. 3) and China’s Hu Jianguan (No. 4). Among them, Panghal has defeated Bennama and Jianguan once each, while he has lost to Zoirov in all his three meetings so far, with the latest being the controversial 2-3 defeat in the final of the Asian boxing championships in Dubai. Against Flissi, Panghal has never competed before. The No. 1 ranking will definitely help Panghal in securing a favorable draw at the Olympics, where he’s unlikely to face any strong challenge before the quarterfinal bout. The top-eight seeds in Tokyo wouldn’t meet before the quarters, leaving Panghal to concentrate on his two matches in the Round of 32 and 16. In the Round of 64, he’s likely to be accorded a bye based on his top billing. The numero uno ranking is also a validation of Panghal’s match consistency, as this is the second time that he’s been ranked No. 1 in less than 15 months. Ahead of the Asian Olympics qualifier in Amman, Jordan in March 2020, the diminutive pugilist was ranked No. 1 by the BTF. Now, as per the rankings released for the Tokyo Olympics (as on June 18, 2021), the Indian has held on to his top spot. As a result, Panghal becomes only the second Indian boxer to reach the top spot since Vijender Singh was ranked No. 1 in the middleweight category in 2009 after securing the World Championships bronze. Among the other Tokyo-bound Indian boxers, six-time world champion, M C Mary Kom, has been ranked seventh in her 51kg category, with her nearest rivals, China’s Chang Yuan (2nd) and Chinese Taipei’s Huang Hsiao-Wen (3rd), placed above her in the BTF rankings. Other three women boxers in the top-10 are Simranjit Kaur (60kg, 4th ranked), Lovlina Borgohain (69kg, 5th ranked) and Pooja Rani Bohra (75kg, 8th ranked). In the men’s category, the four other Tokyo-bound boxers are ranked: Manish Kaushik (63kg, 18th), Vikas Krishan Yadav (69kg, 10th) and Ashish Kumar Chaudhary (75kg, 9th) and Satish Kumar (+91kg, 9th). The IOC’s BTF has the mandate to organise and deliver the qualification events for boxing and the Olympic boxing competitions in Tokyo after the AIBA’s suspension due to concerns over finance, governance, ethics and refereeing and judging.

Paradigm claims it had exclusive rights to negotiate Pacquiao's next two fights and his upcoming bout with Errol Spence Jr. was brokered behind the firm's back.In addition, Paradigm says it paid Pacquiao a $3.3 million contractual advance that he has refused to return.Paradigm is also seeking an injunction to keep Pacquiao from fighting Spence, the undefeated WBC and IBF welterweight champion, on Aug. 21 in Las Vegas. McGregor, the UFC superstar, is the most high-profile client of Paradigm, which also represents MMA stars such as Israel Adesanya and Cris Cyborg."Paradigm Sports' lawsuit against me has no merit. I have an absolute right under the agreement with Paradigm to engage in the upcoming bout with Errol Spence," Pacquiao said in a statement on Sunday. "If this frivolous lawsuit continues, I will be proven correct in court."Pacquiao made news last year when it was announced that he had signed with Paradigm as its first major boxer. Per the complaint, Pacquiao signed an agreement on Feb. 8, 2020, for Paradigm and firm founder Audie Attar to be the boxer's exclusive representation worldwide with the promise that management company would get 10% of Pacquiao's fight purses and 20% of marketing, commercial and media contracts.Paradigm claims that Pacquiao associates undermined the exclusive partnership, working on boxing deals outside of Paradigm's purview beginning almost immediately after the contract was signed -- and Pacquiao never publicly denounced the behavior. The complaint also claims that Pacquiao was negotiating on his own behalf behind Paradigm's back with a Middle Eastern prince.Despite all that, Paradigm says it was able to negotiate a $25 million fight purse for Pacquiao for a bout with Mikey Garcia that would have taken place May 15, 2021, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Pacquiao was to receive a $5 million purse advance. That deal fell apart after Pacquiao attempted to make that $5 million advance a guarantee, even if he did not compete, per the complaint.There were also talks about McGregor being the first of Pacquiao's two final fights, though that idea was pushed back because of a McGregor injury and his loss to Dustin Poirier in January, Burstein wrote in the complaint.Pacquiao announced in May that he would be fighting Spence, a deal that Paradigm claims it was not involved in."Pacquiao knew full well that Paradigm had exclusive rights to schedule his next two immediate fights," Burstein wrote in the complaint. "Nevertheless, in bad faith and material breach of the parties' contracts, Pacquiao, upon information and belief, had surreptitiously entered into a contract to fight Spence."Pacquiao's attorney, Dale Kinsella, issued a statement Saturday night, calling Paradigm's lawsuit "a frivolous effort to interfere with Manny Pacquiao's upcoming mega fight" and saying "it can and will fail for numerous reasons.""Had Manny Pacquiao known that Paradigm Sports appears to have had no intention of fulfilling its contractual obligations, he never would have entered into any relationship with them," Kinsella said in the statement. "Should this matter actually proceed beyond Friday's filing in a court of law, Mr. Pacquiao will vigorously defend this action, assert his own claims against Paradigm Sports, and seek to recover his attorney's fees as well."The complaint stated that as a result of the failed Pacquiao negotiations, Garcia, who was Paradigm's only other boxing client, terminated his management agreement with the firm."Paradigm is a major company, but they were just getting into boxing," Burstein told ESPN. "This is their first foray into boxing and to lose it under those circumstances is a big deal. It has very significant consequences."Burstein said there was an arbitration clause in Pacquiao's contract with Paradigm, but Pacquiao's lawyers told him they didn't think the boxer was bound by it, which is why Burstein filed the lawsuit. Paradigm is also claiming a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment and declaratory relief."It's just extraordinary to me that someone can receive $3.3 million from my client and then forget about the reason why that money was given to him," Burstein said. ... "We're [seeking] in the significant millions of dollars. Certainly high sevens or eights, to be sure."The Athletic was first to report the lawsuit.FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmailTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads© ESPN Enterprises, Inc.

Atlanta led 95-88 before Middleton made his first of three three-pointers during the 13-3 run for a 103-98 lead.After never leading in a 125-91 Game 2 loss, the Hawks were eager for a better start in their first home game of the series. Turnovers by Middleton and Antetokounmpo led to dunks by Clint Capela, and Kevin Huerter added a three-pointer for a 7-0 lead.The Hawks stretched the advantage to 13 points. Antetokounmpo was held to five first-quarter points but regained his scoring form in the second period. He had 11 points in the period as the Bucks finally pulled even at 56-all on a three-pointer by Pat Connaughton with 12 seconds remaining in the half.The Bucks took their first lead at 82-80 on a basket by Bobby Portis Jr. with 1:47 remaining in the third. A three-pointer by Danilo Gallinari gave Atlanta an 85-83 lead at the end of the period.Middleton opened the final period by sinking a 3 that signaled the start of his big period. He went on to outscore the Hawks, who had 17 points, by himself.Hawks fans followed the recent trend of opposing fans counting Antetokounmpo’s time at the free throw line, usually counting past 10 before he launched an attempt.Fans cheered when he missed each of his first two free throws in the first quarter. He threw an airball from the line in the second period, again earning cheers from the sellout crowd.Antetokounmpo was only 6 of 13 for the game.TopicsNBAMilwaukee BucksAtlanta HawksBasketballUS sportsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on WhatsAppShare on MessengerView on theguardian.comShow moreShow moreShow moreShow moreAbout usContact usComplaints and correctionsSecuredropWork for usPrivacy settingsPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersModern Slavery ActDigital newspaper archiveFacebookTwitterAdvertise with usSearch jobsPatronsDiscount CodesSupport The GuardianContributeSubscribeBack to top© 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

(Photo by Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images)If it's Wimbledon -- sparkling whites on green grass - it is Serena Williams and Roger Federer. She's won seven crowns and he has done one better at eight. They're weeks away from their 40th birthdays and are faced with questions they've long answered. The riposte that resounds is the test of time, they're contenders at almost 40. The titans of tradition. Serena, looking for her first major title since the birth of her daughter Olympia nearly four years ago, has been in four finals since, two of them at Wimbledon. In the previous edition of The Championships in 2019, she was outdone by an inspired Simona Halep. Federer, who'll turn 40 four weeks after the tournament draws to a close on July 11, is short of matches, returning as he is from knee surgeries. Unlike in 2017, when he made a six-month, injury-enforced break, look like he had just ducked in and out of one of those wellness retreats, the Swiss appears on edge this time around. Longevity and legendary status might go hand-in-hand, but the 40s wasn't a milestone either the American or the Swiss were looking at. "I remember a conversation with Pistol (Pete Sampras) 10 years ago, when I was just hitting 30," Federer said. "He was wondering how much I had left in the tank. He was thinking I was coming towards the end. The goal was not to play until 40. This came in the last (few) years." Serena, drawn in the tougher half, which is headed by the World No.1 Ashleigh Barty, pointed at technology. "The way we view the game, the way we recover, the way our shoes are made, the way the equipment is made, technology is a huge part of why myself and Roger are playing so long," the sixth seed said. Read AlsoSerena Williams says she will not play at Tokyo OlympicsSerena Williams joined fellow tennis legend Rafael Nadal saying on Sunday she will not play at the Tokyo Olympics next month. The 39-year-old American revealed her decision at her pre-Wimbledon press conference."Normally people retire at 29-30; 32 was the maximum. There are several players at that age now, who are just hitting their stride." Serena is used to being hunted. Hard draws and tough match-ups are par for the course. "It's definitely made me better, I've had a big X on my back since '99 when I won the US Open," she said. "Players play hard every single tournament, every single match, every single Grand Slam (against me)... It's been difficult mentally when someone might beat you and they lose directly in the next round almost every time. At the end of the day, that's why I'm Serena. So thanks." For Federer, who faces Frenchman Adrian Mannarino in his tournament opener, finding form is a task he has set himself largely because of where he is - at home, on his lawns. The grass could be hard on his newly-repaired knee, but it's not something he's willing to consider. At least not loudly. "I still really love it, enjoy myself," he said of competing. "I will see about the results, if they're going to come back. This is why Wimbledon is important to me right now." No matter what happens from when the first ball is struck on a match court at the All England Club on Monday till the curtain comes down on July 11, Serena Williams and Roger Federer are going on 40. And forever GOAT. SMART STATSAshleigh Barty will spend her 82nd and 83rd weeks at the top of the WTA rankings during the Wimbledon fortnight. Barty, who claimed the No.1 spot on June 24, 2019, is only the second Australian to achieve the historic milestone after Evonne Goolagong Cawley. Aryna Sabalenka can potentially challenge for the top spot at Wimbledon, to do so Sabalenka would need to win the title with Barty falling before the semifinals. There are eight teenagers in this year's women's singles draw: Coco Gauff (17), Clara Tauson (18), Emma Raducanu (18), Leylah Fernandez (18), Marta Kostyuk (19*), Katie Volynets (19), Wang Xinyu (19) and Amanda Anisimova (19). Novak Djokovic is bidding to win his 20th Grand Slam title and equal Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal at the top of the all-time list for most Grand Slam men's singles titles. Djokovic and Daniil Medvedev are in contention for the post-Wimbledon No. 1 ranking. Djokovic is guaranteed to remain at No. 1 unless Medvedev wins the title or Medvedev reaches the final and Djokovic loses prior to the final.

According to Willis, they were able to save an older woman from the wreckage as they made their escape from their 11th-floor rental.'Felt like a jet took off right on top of our building'Willis told his story to the Hartford Courant on Saturday, recounting that his family had just started their vacation from New Jersey when a wing of the Champlain Towers condominium complex partially collapsed early Thursday morning. He and his sister, Athena Aguero, were up watching TV and playing video games after their parents had gone to bed when they felt the building shake and heard a noise that sounded like a jet engine.“It felt like a first gust of wind from a storm, then the second one felt kind of like [Super Storm] Sandy, the way I remember it," Willis told the Courant. "It kind of seemed normal for the moment. Then the third one felt like a jet took off right on top of our building. I was expecting to see a plane come right over our balcony.”The noise woke Willis' parents, Albert and Janette Aguero, and the family ran out to the hallway after a cloud of debris surfaced over their oceanfront balcony. Albert told NBC 4 New York that he initially thought the building had been struck by lightning before realizing something much more serious had happened.Next-door apartment was goneWhen they got to the hallway, they saw two holes where elevators used to be. Their neighboring apartment was gone. They found a stairwell and started to make their way down. "I looked to my left and half of the apartment is gone, look forward and the elevator shaft is there and there's no elevator, it's just two holes," Albert told NBC 4. "Panic starts to set in, like we need to really run, because I don't know if the rest of it is coming down. Story continues"We got to the stairwell and when we opened the door, that's when everything really hit, because half the wall to the stairwell was missing, it was kind of open air stairs, so now we're just racing down as fast as possible."General view of the collapsed condo as building tenants remain missing after condo collapse. Credit: (MediaPunch /IPX)After what Willis said was a 15-minute trek down the stairs that included helping a group of people pry open a stuck fire door on the sixth floor, his family found an older woman praying in Spanish on the third floor alongside a younger woman.“She was 88 or 89 years old,” Willis said. “She was saying, ‘I’ve had good life,’ and this and that, and my father speaks Spanish. He told her, ‘We’ll get you out of here.’”According to Willis, they escorted the woman to the first floor where they found the garage to be flooded. They lifted her over a wall before they sprinted to the safety of the nearby beach. Willis told the Courant that he and his sister were just feet away from being crushed in the collapse. “The crazy part was looking in the hallway to our left,” Willis said. “Me and my sister in the living room were probably the closest, were maybe 15 feet away from where the building ended up just breaking off."Willis joined his family on vacation fresh off the conclusion of UConn's baseball season, which included a Big East championship. The Huskies' final game was an NCAA tournament loss to Central Michigan on June 6. Willis made 16 relief appearances as a junior, tallying a 4-0 record with a 2.60 ERA, 20 strikeouts and nine walks in 17.1 innings. One of his four victories arrived in the Big East championship game against Xavier. The search and rescue operation at Champlain Towers remains ongoing, as does the investigation into what caused the collapse.

Few understand the huge cost of maintaining some 7 kilometres of bitumen, ~250 acres of grounds, kilometres of plumbing, wiring, etc. etc. We had every right to be concerned about the future of our business and your recreation. Both venues had to be closed; that is to say we had zero revenue for the entire busiest quarter of the year and even into July. As you would expect, financially FY’20 was not good!We took a very conservative approach to expenditures, with some criticism, and worked hard to conserve the resources we had available to us – especially the fantastic QR Crew. All through this time we have laboured under the constant threat of another long term close down that could really damage the two places we all enjoy and appreciate.Well, the numbers are now in for FY’21. The threat of an extended business closure has diminished, and all our events are humming along with lots of customers. We have hired new people for both inside and outside and extended the reach of our event delivery capability into new areas. Whilst we still have a week to go, we can report that the entire business has performed better than it ever has before and we go into the new financial year with an optimism we did not think was possible a year ago.This is due mainly to the amazing support from all of our customers through a time when flexibility and responsiveness were key to staying in business. Cutting costs to deliver best value to them was the best that we could do to return their faith in sticking with us as we sought to manage the challenges the company was facing. This was where RACERS played a major role with its ability to adapt as the QR Crew ducked and dived, managing one unpredictable situation after another as COVID restrictions changed whilst we struggled to keep everything on an even keel.So, it is with no small amount of pride that we announce we now have the confidence and ability to go back to the 2019 plans to invest in improving the appearance and facilities at QR and Lakeside. Anyone who has been out to Lakeside lately will have commented on how much cleaner and tidier it is looking. QR has also been getting upgrades around the grounds and there have been a number of unseen improvements to the infrastructure in the last few months.Thanks to the customer support and optimism about the coming year we can commit to significant new works to be undertaken during the November – January period which is when things slow down a bit on the event front. Assuming no future extended closures, you can expect to see more spectator facilities at QR. Lakeside will also get some upgrades with extension of its Soft-R-Wall safety furniture, general appearance and facilities from the beginning of next year.If you would like to suggest some investments that you believe will help to improve the safety, and grow the business, please send them to [email protected]On behalf of all the QR Crew, thanks for believing in us and sticking with us to get through a horrendous 15 months when we really did not know what the future was going to bring.Twenty two – our time to renew.Thanks for everything, John TetleyJoin the discussion below in the Speedcafe.com comments sectionPlease note: Speedcafe.com reserves the right to remove any comment that does not follow the comment policy.

You can see the quality of the at-bats are a lot better now than they were a few weeks ago. They’re getting there,” Cora said via Zoom after the Sox improved to 47-31, widening their lead over their fourth-place rivals to 6 ½ games. “When Gary [Sanchez] is swinging the bat the way he is, DJ [LeMahieu] is getting on base, they become very dangerous.“Like even today, we never felt comfortable because you know they’re going to put quality at-bats. … Overall, for us, obviously it’s nice. But we’ll take six [wins] for right now.”The Red Sox, who finished 24-36 and in last place in the 2020 pandemic-shortened season, continue to pound the ball with a high-powered lineup featuring sluggers Rafael Devers, J.D. Martinez and Xander Bogaerts.Christian Vazquez celebrates Rafael Devers’ three-run homer. EPAAfter Kiké Hernandez belted Cole’s first pitch of the game for a leadoff homer, Devers clubbed a 101 mph fastball from the Yankees ace into the right-field bleachers for a three-run shot and a 4-0 lead after one inning.“Obviously as tough a pitcher as [Cole] is, he’s a really good pitcher and someone that you can’t overlook. But he has his moments, just like all of us, ups and downs, and today we were able to get him,” Devers, who is second in MLB with 64 RBIs, said through an interpreter. “We came into this series and knew we had to handle our business, especially at home. see also Gerrit Cole getting ‘ambushed’ was start to miserable day Gerrit Cole’s much-discussed spin rates ticked upward on all four... “We were out there being aggressive, trying to play good defense, doing what we have to do on the base paths. Overall, it was a really great series for the entire team.”And another clunker for the Yanks, who fell to 11-12 in June. Martinez also homered against Cole as the Sox took a 6-0 lead in the third.Aaron Judge belted a homer in the sixth for the Yanks’ only two runs off Boston starter Eduardo Rodriguez, who missed the entire 2020 season after a positive COVID-19 test and a resultant case of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart).“It’s fun whenever we win games, it doesn’t matter who we’re facing,” Rodriguez said. “If we want to go to the playoffs and go to the World Series we know it’s not just ‘win three games against the Yankees.’“It’s ‘win against every team in the league.’ ”The Yanks got the tying run to the plate after loading the bases in the seventh, but former Yankees farmhand Garrett Whitlock struck out LeMahieu and retired Judge on a pop-up to escape the jam. Whitlock, selected by Boston out of the Yanks’ minor league system in the offseason Rule 5 draft, sports a 1.42 ERA through 22 appearances this season, including 5 ¹/₃ -scoreless innings against his former organization.“Anytime we get a win against anybody it’s great, but then obviously with the history between the Red Sox and the Yankees, you love to beat the Yankees any chance you get,” Whitlock said. “To take six off them so far this year, hopefully we take a lot more than just six.” Filed under boston red sox , new york yankees , 6/27/21 Share this article:Share this:FacebookTwitterFlipboardWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Yankees ace getting 'ambushed' was start to miserable day Share SelectionColumnists Mark Cannizzaro Local golf course delivers thrills others lack Ken Davidoff Yankees desperately need to shake up their roster see all columnistsSports PodcastsTHE BEST INSIGHTS FROM THE ULTIMATE INSIDERSJalen Rose: Renaissance ManListen on Apple Podcasts | SpotifyPinstripe Pod: A NY Yankees Baseball PodcastListen on Apple Podcasts | SpotifyAmazin' But True: A NY Mets Baseball PodcastListen on Apple Podcasts | SpotifyBig Apple Buckets: A NY Knicks Basketball PodcastListen on Apple Podcasts | SpotifyFullcourt on Flatbush: A Brooklyn Nets BasketballListen on Apple Podcasts | Spotify Scoreboard what to shop now The best expert-approved face masks to wear on long flights: KN95s and more The best of the lululemon Wunder Train collection The best beach gear and accessories to pack in your bag this summer This sleek, minimalist electric toothbrush is on sale now for $65 off Keep your fruits and veggies fresh for longer with these sealed reusable bags More Stories page six Michael Strahan's ex-wife arrested for allegedly harassing her former girlfriend nypost Grandson getting eerie calls from landline of couple missing in Florida building collapse New York Post Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email YouTube Email NewslettersMobile AppsContact UsTips Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email YouTube Sections & FeaturesNewsMetroSportsBusinessOpinionEntertainmentFashionShoppingLivingMediaTechReal EstateVideoPhotosAlexaCoversHoroscopesSports OddsPodcastsColumnistsClassifiedsNewsletters & FeedsEmail NewslettersRSS FeedsNY Post Official StoreHome DeliverySubscribeManage SubscriptionDelivery HelpHelp/SupportAbout New York PostCustomer ServiceApp FAQ & HelpCommunity GuidelinesContact UsTipsNewsroomLetters to the EditorReprintsCareersAppsiPhone AppiPad AppAndroid PhoneAndroid TabletAdvertiseMedia KitContact © 2021 NYP Holdings, Inc.

Left-hander Miguel Del Pozo was called up from Triple-A Toledo to take Fulmer’s spot on the active roster. Despite the rather ominous-sounding official injury designation, “the normal term is his neck is bothering him,” manager A.J. Hinch told The Detroit News’ Chris McCosky and other reporters. Fulmer felt the injury following yesterday’s outing against the Astros, which saw the righty allow three runs on two homers over an inning of work.While the issue doesn’t sound overly serious, it does represent at least 10 fewer days for opposing scouts and front offices to gauge Fulmer’s value as a trade candidate. The 2016 AL Rookie Of The Year has reinvented himself as a reliever coming off Tommy John surgery in 2019 and some tough results as a starter in 2020, and Fulmer has a 3.62 ERA, 29.66% strikeout rate, and 5.08% walk rate in 27 1/3 innings out of the bullpen this season. He has also shown some quality in high-leverage situations, racking up six saves as part of Detroit’s closer committee.With Fulmer still under control through one final arbitration year in 2022, he makes for an interesting trade chip for the Tigers to shop prior to July 30, assuming that he is able to return from the IL in good condition. An enterprising team could acquire Fulmer as bullpen help for this season, and then perhaps consider stretching him out next spring for one last crack at starting pitching, with a return to the relief corps available as a fallback option.The transaction also creates another opportunity for Del Pozo, who didn’t get a chance to pitch when he was briefly called up to the Tigers earlier this month. Del Pozo signed a minor league deal with Detroit last winter, and over 13 innings with the Angels and Pirates in 2019-20, the southpaw issued 16 walks and posted a 12.46 ERA. At Triple-A Toledo this season, however, Del Pozo has a 1.02 ERA over 17 2/3 innings, with a 35.4% strikeout rate and (perhaps most importantly) a much more palatable 9.23% walk rate.Share 0Retweet 3Send via email0Detroit Tigers Michael Fulmer Miguel Del Pozo TransactionsMLBTR Chat TranscriptMainAthletics Sign Homer Bailey To Minors Contract View Comments (6)newest oldestCommentsFever Pitch Guy 2 hours ago Thoughts and prayers for a speedy recovery. 2Reply Ducky Buckin Fent 57 mins ago I can’t tell if you are being sincere or sarcastic.Being me I think sincere.

The Blazers offered Billups the job on Friday night, and the sides had been progressing on a deal to replace former coach Terry Stotts over the weekend.The Blazers' landing of Billups sets the franchise's direction of trying to maximize the prime years of All-NBA guard Damian Lillard's career by elevating the team into deeper runs in the Western Conference playoffs. Portland advanced to two conference semifinals and a conference finals in the Lillard-Olshey-Stotts era.After Blazers chair Jody Allen and Olshey met with Billups in Seattle on Wednesday, they were convinced that he was the right candidate, sources said.Before making a formal offer on Friday night, the Blazers continued investigating a 1997 rape allegation against Billups, sources said. No criminal charges were brought, but Billups settled a civil lawsuit filed by the woman.Although Billups had been vetted several times for high-level NBA leadership jobs, including an offer to become president of basketball operations for the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2017 and in his current role with the Clippers, the Blazers used much of the search process to revisit the allegations from Billups' rookie season in the NBA, sources said.Billups encouraged the examination, sources said, and his answers in several conversations with Blazers officials aligned with findings from an independent investigation, sources said. The Blazers ultimately found nothing that they believed disqualified Billups from becoming the franchise's new head coach.The Clippers credit Billups for his success in working with All-Star Paul George to advance his playmaking skills this season. Olshey's history with Billups goes back, among other ways, to their time together with the Clippers in the 2011-2012 season.Olshey has long considered Billups one of the best leaders he had ever encountered in the NBA, and that relationship -- along with Lillard's public endorsement -- played a part in Billups choosing the Portland job over other opportunities, sources said.Billups is tasked with elevating a Blazers defense that ranked among the worst in the league last season and continuing to build on a top-rated offense featuring Lillard and CJ McCollum."Portland is a special place and a unique franchise," Billups said in a statement. "As a player I always loved playing here because the passion and knowledge of the fans brought out the very best in me as a competitor. Now I'm looking forward to being on the other side of that energy and engaging with the Portland community on a whole other level."Portland plans to be aggressive in surrounding Billups, who served one season as a Clippers assistant, with an experienced coaching staff. Billups replaces Stotts, who left Portland after eight straight trips to the playoffs that included three first-round exits in the past four years.Brooklyn Nets assistant Mike D'Antoni and San Antonio Spurs assistant Becky Hammon also met with Allen and Olshey in Seattle, sources said.Billups was a five-time NBA All-Star and the MVP of the 2004 NBA Finals as a member of the Detroit Pistons.FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmailTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementDo Not Sell My InfoContact UsDisney Ad Sales SiteCopyright: © ESPN Enterprises, Inc.

Video / Sky SportMunster revealed his frustrations with the team's performance at halftime when conducting a brief interview. Video / Sky Sportnews.com.auQueensland hero Cameron Munster has been told to close his mouth after an incredible halftime interview during Queensland's State of Origin humiliation on Sunday night.The Maroons star failed to inject himself into the game as Queensland's attack fell apart on the back of a beaten up forward pack and a clunky divide between the Storm five-eighth and Queensland halfback Daly Cherry-Evans.The Maroons captain fought back tears in an on-field interview after his side's demoralising defeat. Munster had different emotions.He was unstoppable in the 2020 series, but looked dejected as early as halftime of Game 2 at Suncorp Stadium as his side went on to be thrashed 26-0 by NSW, coughing up a 76-6 series differential following on from Game 1's 50-6 hiding in Townsville.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Munster revealed his frustrations at halftime when conducting a brief interview — and his answer has seen him torched by Queensland legend Copper Cronk.Cronk said after the game Munster should never have admitted his frustrations at his team's offensive breakdown.Munster had told Channel 9's Darren Lockyer: "We are not very in sync at the moment."A lot of players are doing different things and we are calling up players and unfortunately it is not getting there so we need to have a chat at halftime and make sure we get to our spots because obviously they are getting over us."Cronk couldn't believe the words that came out of Munster's mouth."That is something that shouldn't come out of one of your gun players' mouths"," he told Fox League.Related articlesSportWarriors boss weighs in on Reece Walsh's Origin injury27 Jun, 2021 09:40 PMQuick ReadSportNew South Wales dominate Queensland in historic Origin bloodbath27 Jun, 2021 12:30 PMQuick ReadSportIneligible Kiwi-born wing to be banned from Origin26 Jun, 2021 11:45 PMQuick ReadSportSeason thrown into chaos: Crisis meeting to decide Warriors' lockdown fate26 Jun, 2021 06:45 PMQuick ReadCronk reveals where it all went wrong for QueenslandCronk said the ultimate responsibility for Queensland's attacking flop rests on Cherry-Evans and Munster.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME."It comes down to the spine and the communicators," he said."When someone is being called there has got to be a few chiefs there — the one that is going to take the bull by the horns and dominate the calls. At the end of the day Munster is the go-to and you've got to create space for your go-to players."Questions surround Cherry-Evans' Origin futureDaly Cherry-Evans of the Maroons reacts after losing game two of the 2021 State of Origin series. Photo / GettyCronk and a host of rugby league greats have put Queensland captain Cherry-Evans' future on the discussion table after the Manly playmaker struggled to find a way to dig Queensland out of trouble."There's no doubt there will be question marks over the halves," Cronk said. "I think Munster has the runs on the board because of what he did last year and what he does with his age going forward."Obviously Cherry-Evans has struggled, hasn't really dominated the Origin arena like some of the Queensland captains in the past. At the end of the day every one of the Queensland players let down the jersey and there will be repercussions.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME."We spoke about the clunkiness when they had good ball and in the first half they got there but it looked lacklustre."No one was on the same page, they weren't moving together. In the second half they had a few opportunities but just didn't score."It came after Blues legend Andrew Johns publicly questioned the Manly halfback's performance. "There's going to be a big debate about the halfback position with Cherry-Evans," he said in commentary for Channel 9.Vautin's scathing review of QueenslandMaroons legend Paul Vautin has also written Queensland off ahead of Game 3, leaving Queensland facing the prospect of a 3-0 sweep."They may as well call off the third (game)," Vautin said.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Vautin repeatedly singled out Queensland's slow outside backs as the team's biggest weakness."I think we are a slow and sluggish team," he said."I really believe we just don't have enough pace and we were gone after 10 minutes, so it makes you wonder."There was no punch at the line. People were just trotting into the line. It was very, very disappointing. Quite deflating to sit there and watch what they produced tonight."He went on to say he didn't have any answers for how Queensland can turn it around for Game 3, scheduled for July 14 at Stadium Australia in Sydney."I'm not sure where they go to. I'm not sure they have a lot of other players to pick from," he said.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME."I hope Reece Walsh gets another chance and he is fit because he's the sort of player they need. They lack spark."I think we're lacking centres. (Kurt) Capewell got a bath again tonight. He did try hard. He tried really hard.

The Blazers offered Billups the job on Friday night, and the sides had been progressing on a deal to replace former coach Terry Stotts over the weekend.The Blazers' landing of Billups sets the franchise's direction of trying to maximize the prime years of All-NBA guard Damian Lillard's career by elevating the team into deeper runs in the Western Conference playoffs. Portland advanced to two conference semifinals and a conference finals in the Lillard-Olshey-Stotts era.After Blazers chair Jody Allen and Olshey met with Billups in Seattle on Wednesday, they were convinced that he was the right candidate, sources said.Before making a formal offer on Friday night, the Blazers continued investigating a 1997 rape allegation against Billups, sources said. No criminal charges were brought, but Billups settled a civil lawsuit filed by the woman.Although Billups had been vetted several times for high-level NBA leadership jobs, including an offer to become president of basketball operations for the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2017 and in his current role with the Clippers, the Blazers used much of the search process to revisit the allegations from Billups' rookie season in the NBA, sources said.Billups encouraged the examination, sources said, and his answers in several conversations with Blazers officials aligned with findings from an independent investigation, sources said. The Blazers ultimately found nothing that they believed disqualified Billups from becoming the franchise's new head coach.The Clippers credit Billups for his success in working with All-Star Paul George to advance his playmaking skills this season. Olshey's history with Billups goes back, among other ways, to their time together with the Clippers in the 2011-2012 season.Olshey has long considered Billups one of the best leaders he had ever encountered in the NBA, and that relationship -- along with Lillard's public endorsement -- played a part in Billups choosing the Portland job over other opportunities, sources said.Billups is tasked with elevating a Blazers defense that ranked among the worst in the league last season and continuing to build on a top-rated offense featuring Lillard and CJ McCollum."Portland is a special place and a unique franchise," Billups said in a statement. "As a player I always loved playing here because the passion and knowledge of the fans brought out the very best in me as a competitor. Now I'm looking forward to being on the other side of that energy and engaging with the Portland community on a whole other level."Portland plans to be aggressive in surrounding Billups, who served one season as a Clippers assistant, with an experienced coaching staff. Billups replaces Stotts, who left Portland after eight straight trips to the playoffs that included three first-round exits in the past four years.Brooklyn Nets assistant Mike D'Antoni and San Antonio Spurs assistant Becky Hammon also met with Allen and Olshey in Seattle, sources said.Billups was a five-time NBA All-Star and the MVP of the 2004 NBA Finals as a member of the Detroit Pistons.FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmailTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementDo Not Sell My InfoContact UsDisney Ad Sales SiteCopyright: © ESPN Enterprises, Inc.

The final events of the day have been pushed into the evening.By Scott Cacciola and Kevin DraperThe tenth and final day of the United States track and field Olympic trials was a scorcher, both on and off the track.It reached 110 degrees in Eugene, Ore., the hottest temperature on record, and the trials were postponed by five hours to avoid the afternoon sun. When running did resume late at night one world record was broken, and every race had a scintillating finish. Sydney McLaughlin broke the women’s 400 meter hurdles record in qualifying for her first Olympics, beating out 2016 Olympics gold medalist Dalilah Muhammad. University of Oregon standout Cole Hocker outsprinted former Oregon standout (and Olympic gold medalist) Matthew Centrowitz to win the men’s 1,500 meter race, though Hocker has not yet run the qualifying time and it is not yet clear if he will go to the Olympics. Athing Mu, a 19-year-old standout, won the women’s 800 meter race in the second fastest time ever run by an American. Noah Lyles qualified for his first Olympics in the men’s 200 meter race, where he will be joined by 17-year-old Erriyon Knighton.Read more below about the heat and all the competition.

But one of those losses was at the 2016 United States Olympic trials, when he took fourth place.Lyles, 23, wasn’t about to let that happen again. Despite not looking his best in the qualifying rounds, Lyles won the 200 meter final in 19.74 seconds, the fastest time in the world this year.He will be joined by the next Noah Lyles, or perhaps the next Usain Bolt. Erriyon Knighton, a 17-year-old whose 19.88 in the semifinals broke Bolt’s under-20 record, took third with a time of 19.84. Knighton will be the youngest American man to compete in track and field at the Olympics since Jim Ryun ran in the 1500 meter race in 1964.Kenny Bednarek finished in second place with a time of 19.78.— Kevin DraperCole Hocker outkicks Matthew Centrowitz in the 1500-meters.Cole Hocker, who recently finished his freshman year at the University of Oregon, unleashed a massive kick to win the 1,500 meter final.Credit...Alexandra Garcia/The New York TimesThrough three rounds of racing at the trials, Matthew Centrowitz, the reigning Olympic champion in the men’s 1,500 meters, made a habit of pointing to the track whenever he was introduced to the crowd, as if to say: I own this place.On Sunday, he discovered that he had some company. Cole Hocker, who recently finished his freshman year at the University of Oregon, outkicked Centrowitz to win the final. Hocker, who finished in 3:35.28, does not yet have the Olympic standard but could have the points (thanks to a very convoluted ranking system) to race in Tokyo.Yared Nuguse, the Notre Dame senior, finished third, and Craig Engels was fourth.Centrowitz led at the bell lap and appeared to be extending his lead coming off the final turn, but Hocker unleashed a massive kick, beating him across the finish by less than stride.— Scott CacciolaAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAthing Mu easily wins the 800-meter race.Credit...Alexandra Garcia/The New York TimesAthing Mu, a middle distance prodigy who just turned 19, ran away from the field to easily win the women’s 800 meter race in 1:56.07, the second fastest time ever run by an American, and the fastest run by anyone this year.Mu’s race almost ended just 150 meters in, when Nia Akins stepped on the back of her shoe. But Mu only stumbled and recovered, and took the lead for good halfway through the race.Raevyn Rogers, a University of Oregon alumni whose visage is on the massive Bowerman Tower that the runners passed twice, qualified for her first Olympics by taking second.

McLaughlin finished in 51.90 seconds, becoming the first woman to run the race in less than 52 seconds. She looked up at the clock and put her hands over her mouth in shock as Muhammad ran to her to celebrate.Muhammad, the reigning Olympic and world champion, finished second in 52.42 seconds, and Anna Cockrell was third.McLaughlin, 21, was still in high school when she qualified to compete at the 2016 Olympics, and was celebrated as a prodigy on the rise. In Rio de Janeiro, she advanced to the semifinals before she was eliminated at age 17. Now, she will head to Tokyo as the favorite in an event that is packed with talent.Muhammad, 31, has faced some challenges since breaking her own world record — and outracing McLaughlin — at the 2019 world championships. She was hampered by hamstring injuries and said she tested positive with Covid in February.“That definitely impacted my training,” she said last week. “But I kind of got my fitness back right when I needed to.”McLaughlin, though, has spent months rounding into top form. She worked on her speed ahead of the trials by dipping down to race several times in the 110-meter hurdles at the behest of her coach, Bob Kersee. On Sunday, when the lights were the brightest, it showed. No one has ever been faster.— Scott CacciolaHere are the qualifiers in Sunday’s field events.JuVaughn Harrison won both the high jump and the long jump, the first American to do so since 1912. Credit...Alexandra Garcia/The New York TimesA number of field events were completed before short and middle distance races took the spotlight. Here are those results: Men’s high jumpTwo weekends after winning the high jump at the N.C.A.A. championships, JuVaughn Harrison of Louisiana State won at the trials by surpassing 2.33 meters. That height was matched by Darryl Sullivan, from Tennessee, but he took second by virtue of missing more jumps than Harrison. Shelby McEwen, who qualified for and competed at the 2019 world championships, took third.Women’s heptathalonAnnie Kunz won the heptathlon on the strength of her all-around performance, never finishing below sixth among the 18 competitors in any event. Kendell Williams, who finished fifth in the heptathlon at the 2016 Rio Olympics, took second. They will be joined in Tokyo by Erica Bougard, who has competed in three world championships, but never at an Olympics.Men’s long jumpHours after winning the high jump, JuVaughn Harrison won the long jump with a jump of 8.47 meters. No American has qualified for the Olympics in both events since Jim Thorpe in 1912. Marquis Dendy, who qualified for the Rio Olympics but pulled out with injury, took second place. Steffin McCarter, from the University of Texas, jumped a personal best to take the final spot. Jeff Henderson, who won this event at the Rio Olympics, will not be defending his gold, finishing sixth. Jarrion Lawson, who finished fourth at the Rio Olympics and has won silver at a world championships, did not attempt any jumps. It was not immediately clear if he was injured, or why he did not jump. — Kevin DraperAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe high school prodigy Hobbs Kessler is not in this 1,500 final.Hobbs Kessler, the fastest high school miler ever, did not qualify for the 1,500-meter final.Credit...Steph Chambers/Getty ImagesThe men’s 1,500-meter final has it all — everything, that is, except for a high school prodigy. Missing from the lineup is Hobbs Kessler, who recently finished his senior year in Ann Arbor, Mich. Kessler, 18, executed some brilliant tactics in the first round to advance into Friday’s semifinals. He was poised, confident, and wise beyond his years.There were whispers among the track-and-field intelligentsia that an Olympic berth — even for someone so young — was not entirely outside the realm of possibilities. He finished eighth in his heat, behind Matthew Centrowitz and Cole Hocker, among others.But his relative inexperience seemed to catch up with him Friday, when he found himself missing an extra gear down the backstretch in a slow heat. Still, Kessler’s brightest years seem to be ahead of him. He turned professional during the middle of trials, signing with Adidas.— Scott CacciolaTaliyah Brooks collapsed before a heptathlon event. She was allowed to re-enter the competition, but withdrew.Taliyah Brooks is helped off track after collapsing during the heptathlon. The temperature was well above 100 degrees.Credit...Charlie Riedel/Associated PressTaliyah Brooks, who collapsed just before the javelin throw in the heptathlon competition at the U.S. Olympic track and field trials Sunday afternoon, was allowed to re-enter the competition but later withdrew Sunday evening. Brooks was in fourth place after five of the seven events, including four on Saturday and the long jump earlier on Sunday. But before the javelin throw on Sunday, with temperatures well above 100 degrees, Brooks appeared to faint and did not participate, which would normally have disqualified her.Shortly after the other competitors completed the javelin throw, the trials were delayed by five hours, when it should finally be under 100 degrees. The temperature in Eugene, Ore., reached 110 degrees Sunday, becoming the hottest day on record for the city.Eugene, Oregon has also joined the 110°F club this afternoon. This temperature breaks their ALL TIME record high temperature of 108°F set on August 9th 1981. Records for this site go back to the 1890s. Their dewpoint is also running 65-67°F, too! #pdxtst #orwx #wawx— NWS Portland (@NWSPortland) June 27, 2021U.S.A. Track & Field announced that they had approved a request from Brooks to re-enter the competition, and that she would throw the javelin solo before rejoining the other heptathlon competitors for the final event, the 800-meter race, 15 minutes later. But as she was supposed to be throwing the javelin, a terse statement was sent out that Brooks withdrew. — Kevin DraperTrack trials delayed for hours because of excessive heat.Credit...Alexandra Garcia/The New York TimesThe hot temperatures were nearly unbearable at the U.S. Olympic track and field trials in recent days. But meet officials finally pulled the plug on the races at about 3:30 p.m. Pacific Time on Sunday, announcing in a terse statement that they were delaying the final day of competition until 8:30 p.m. The event will now be televised on NBCSN instead of NBC. The scoreboard at Hayward Field at the University of Oregon in Eugene indicated the temperature was 105 degrees Fahrenheit when the announcement was made.The delay was announced about 30 minutes before the men’s long jumpers were set to compete — and less than an hour before the runners in the men’s 1,500 meters were set to run their final. The heat should not have come as a surprise to meet officials; temperatures were forecast to approach 110 degrees by midafternoon.Several marquee finals are scheduled for Sunday — or Sunday night, rather — including the men’s 1,500, the men’s 200 and the women’s 400 hurdles.The men’s high jump managed to wrap up before the afternoon session was suspended. JuVaughn Harrison won the event, while Darryl Sullivan finished second and Shelby McEwen finished third.The women’s heptathlon has one event remaining — the 800 — with Kendell Williams holding a slim two-point lead over Annie Kunz.

Her best throw of 263 feet 6 inches was the sixth-best throw in history and the longest in the world since 2017. Brooke Andersen qualified in second place with a throw of 255 feet.Gwen Berry finished third to secure her spot on the national team — and a place on the podium, which is where she made another statement during the medal ceremony.Organizers have been playing the national anthem in Hayward Field at the start of the evening sessions throughout the trials. On Saturday, the song happened to start while Berry was still on the podium after receiving her bronze medal. Berry, who has used her platform to speak out against systemic racism, turned away from the flag. At one point, she held up a black T-shirt that read “ATHLETE, ACTIVIST.”“I feel like it was a setup,” Berry said of the timing of the anthem. “I felt like they did that on purpose.”After winning gold at the 2019 Pan American Games, Berry raised her fist during the anthem and was reprimanded by the International Olympic Committee.— Scott CacciolaOn Saturday, Emily Sisson kept her cool and dominated the field.Emily Sisson set a meet record in the 10,000.Credit...Alexandra Garcia/The New York TimesAs was the case with the men’s 5,000 meters on Sunday, officials moved the women’s 10,000 to Saturday morning in an attempt to beat the afternoon heat. Still, the temperature in Eugene, Ore., was in the mid-80s at the start of the race, and the field thinned as Emily Sisson took firm control after the first few laps.Sisson, 29, methodically quickened her pace as she lapped many of her competitors, running to a first-place finish in 31:03.82, a U.S. trials record. It was a comeback more than a year in the making: Sisson had been one of the favorites at the marathon trials in February 2020, but dropped out after 22 miles.“That broke my heart,” she said, adding of her triumphant return in the 10,000: “It was so much work. But it was so worth it.”Karissa Schweizer, who had already qualified for the Olympics in the 5,000, finished second behind Sisson, while Alicia Monson was third — and wound up in the hospital to receive intravenous fluids. “It’s not every day that you become an Olympian and also get hospitalized from both heat stroke and hypothermia,” she shared. — Scott CacciolaAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyGabby Thomas is an Olympian. Now, on to a master’s degree.Credit...Alexandra Garcia/The New York TimesGabby Thomas, 24, is a Harvard graduate who is working toward a master’s degree in epidemiology. She is also a first-time Olympian.On Saturday, she raced away from a deep and talented field to win the women’s 200 meters in 21.61 seconds, which was the third-fastest time in history. Only Florence Griffith-Joyner has ever run faster, and Thomas — who obliterated her own personal best — says she’s primed for Tokyo. She cited the importance of balance in her life.“Being in school really makes me appreciate what I’m doing on the track,” said Thomas, who now trains and studies in Texas. “It makes you appreciate the time. When I go to the track, this is my time to be on the track and be free.”Thomas added she had drawn inspiration from the woman who had raced to a fifth-place finish: Allyson Felix.“She was the first person I remember watching on TV, the person who has been in the back of my head,” Thomas said. “To be on the team with her makes me want to cry.”Felix, one of the most decorated American athletes of all time, had already assured herself a spot in her fifth and final Olympics by finishing second in the 400 meters last week. But while she did not qualify in the 200, she was well aware of the significance of Saturday’s race. It would be her final time competing at the trials.“Today was just about soaking it in,” she said. “The last time around. I just wanted to take it all in and do the best that I could, and just say thank you to everyone who has supported me along the way. It was really special.”Thomas was followed by Jenna Prandini in second and Anavia Battle in third. All three broke 22 seconds, a notable mark for 200-meter runners.— Scott CacciolaIt’s very, very hot in Eugene.Chari Hawkins competes in heptathlon at the U.S. Olympic trials.Credit...Alexandra Garcia/The New York TimesEUGENE, Ore. — The 10th and final day of the U.S. Olympic track and field trials started earlier than originally planned on Sunday, and it had everything to do with the one thing that none of the athletes could control: the weather.Perhaps you’ve heard? It has been hot — so very hot — in the Pacific Northwest in recent days, and temperatures were forecast to approach 110 degrees on Sunday as the trials were set to wind down with seven finals and the conclusion of the women’s heptathlon.Well, the PDX airport is currently sitting at 110 degrees as of 2:03 PM PDT. This is the hottest temperature ever recorded at the airport since historical records began in 1940. We expect temperatures to continue rising a bit more over the next couple of hours. #PNWHeatwave— NWS Portland (@NWSPortland) June 27, 2021One of those finals, the men’s 5,000 meters, was moved from mid-afternoon to mid-morning, when it was expected to be slightly (slightly) cooler. Temperatures were nearing 90 degrees ahead of the start. The broiling conditions seemed to make no difference to Paul Chelimo, who raced to the win in 13 minutes 26.82 seconds — and occasionally wagged his finger at his opponents.“Go hard or suffer the rest of your life,” Chelimo said in a post-race television interview.Chelimo, the Olympic silver medalist in 2016, was closely followed by Grant Fisher and Woody Kincaid, both of whom had already qualified for the Olympics in the 10,000 meters.— Scott Cacciola“I was like, ‘Daaaang!’” Hurdlers steal the show.Credit...Alexandra Garcia/The New York TimesIn winning the men’s 400-meter hurdles on Saturday, Rai Benjamin came tantalizingly close to breaking one of the sport’s most longstanding records. Benjamin finished in 46.83 seconds, just off Kevin Young’s world record of 46.78, which he set when he won gold at the 1992 Olympics.Kenny Selmon and David Kendziera finished second and third with lifetime bests.“I was like, ‘Daaaang!’” Benjamin said of narrowly missing the record. “It hurts a little bit that it was right there and I couldn’t grab it. But it’s just more fuel for the fire.”For all his pyrotechnics, Benjamin might not have even been the most compelling hurdler at Hayward Field. Competition came in the form of Grant Holloway, who dominated the men’s 110-meter hurdles to secure his Olympic berth. His fastest time came in the semifinals when he ran 12.81 seconds to finish a hundredth of a second off the world record. He won the final in 12.96 seconds. Even as he left the stadium abuzz, Holloway was oddly matter-of-fact about his day at the office: He did what he expected to do. Onto the next one. “No emotions at all,” he said. “That’s what happens when you execute at a high level.”The former Oregon football star Devon Allen (who placed fifth in the event in Rio) finished second behind Benjamin, and Daniel Roberts was third.— Scott CacciolaSite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2021 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions

His hamstrings hurt. His back was sore. After 80 holes in 26.7 degree heat, he was struggling to focus. Darkness was becoming a factor. He lost count of how many holes he had played. “It’s hard to stay mentally into it,” English said on Monday after winning an eight-hole playoff – tied for the second-longest sudden death in PGA Tour history – to beat Kramer Hickok and win the Travelers Championship. “Hats off to him for a good fight,” said English, who shot a 5-under 65 to finish at 13 under and then rattled off seven pars in the playoff before holing a 16-foot birdie putt for the win. “We were both joking that somebody’s got to make a birdie sometime. I had that putt a few times, and I finally read it right.”John Minchillo/APHarris English survived a marathon eight-hole playoff to win the Travelers Championship. Both players birdied the final hole in regulation to force the playoff, which is second only to the 11-hole sudden death in the 1949 Motor City Open, when Lloyd Mangrum and Cary Middlecoff were declared co-winners by mutual agreement due to darkness. Four other events have reached an eighth sudden death hole.

It was the second win this year and the fourth career victory for English, who finished third at the US Open last week – and fourth in the pandemic-delayed U.S. Open in September. He won US$1,368,000 and 500 FedEx Cup points, moving into second in the standings. English sank a 28-footer on the 72nd hole to emerge from a three-way tie and finish at 13 under. Then he headed to the range to stay warm in case Hickock, who was minus-12 with two holes to play, could catch him. The 29-year-old Texan, who had never won on the PGA Tour, couldn’t convert a 39-foot birdie putt on the 17th, but he knocked in a nine-footer for birdie on No. 18 to match English. They played 18 again – twice – and parred it again – twice. On to No. 17, then 18, then 17, then 18, then 18 again: All pars. Hickok lipped out on two long birdie putts that would have won it; on the sixth playoff hole, English missed a seven-foot birdie putt to win. The crowd at the 18th green chanted “Kramer!” and did the wave while it waited for the golfers to head back and forth to the tee. On the final trip down the 438-yard par 4 – their seventh of the day and 10th of the weekend – Hickok put his second shot 28 feet from the pin and two-putted. English landed his approach 16 feet away and made birdie. “I don’t know how many it went,” English said afterward. “That was incredible. What an experience, and the fans were awesome. They’re always great here in Hartford, and glad we got to give them a little show at the end.”John Minchillo/APKramer Hickok came up short in the marathon eight-hole playoff. Hickok has never won on the PGA Tour. The second-place finish was his best ever, topping a tie for eighth in the 2018 Bermuda Championship that was his only other time in the top 10. “I learned that I belong,” said Hickok, who was joined after the round by his wife and his puppy, Elvis. “It was a huge learning experience for me." Four players were tied at 12 under after Bubba Watson bogeyed the 14th. But the three-time Travelers winner played the last five holes at six over to drop out of the chase. “I’m glad that I was there, had the opportunity,” Watson said. “You know, I would love to do it again next week, throw up on myself again. It would it be great. I want to the opportunity and the chance to win.” Watson’s collapse left Hickok – his 54-hole co-leader – on top at 12 under with English and Marc Leishman, who had finished his round with a 64 two hours earlier. English finished the fourth round birdie-bogey-birdie, skipping after the ball and pumping his fist after the final hole of regulation. Hickok’s celebration was even more emphatic.John Minchillo/APHarris English is congratulated by his caddie after winning the Travelers Championship. But there was still a playoff to come. “I never thought I’d be playing 27 holes today,” Hickok said. “I was just trying to put as much pressure on him as possible. He was trying to do the same. I put him in uncomfortable spots, he put me in some too, and he came out on top today, and that’s a true champion.” Leishman won the tournament in 2012, shooting a 62 on Monday to come from six strokes behind and earn his first career victory on the tour. This year, he shot 64 in the final round and was the leader in the clubhouse for several hours at 12 under but settled for third. With plenty of low scores Monday and all of the leaders still on the course, he sensed it wasn’t enough. “Nice to make a run and be around the lead,” said Leishman, who did head out to the range to warm up before English took his place. “Not holding my breath, but I won’t be going anywhere.” Abraham Ancer (65) was fourth at minus-11. Kevin Kisner had his second 63 of the tournament – along with a 70 and a 74 – to tie for fifth at 10 under with Brooks Koepka (65) and three others. A top-five finish would have moved Dustin Johnson back to the No. 1 spot in the world. But the defending champion shot 71 on Monday to tied for 25th at 6 under.APmost popularCovid-19 NZ live: Cabinet has commissed advice around potentially making QR scanning compulsory, Ardern saysSurprise!

Third-round leader Bubba Watson led midway through the back nine in Sunday's fourth round with English and Hickok drifting in and out of the lead and co-lead. Finally, Watson ejected by playing his last five in 6 over, and English and Hickok took the stage.First, English hit a 28-footer on the 18th hole in regulation to get to 13 under. Hickok covered him up with a 6-foot par putt on No. 17 and a 9-foot birdie on No. 18. If he'd missed either, this column would have been written two hours earlier than it was written.✅ Epic finishing birdie✅ Epic celebration pic.twitter.com/GwMQUp3RS6— PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) June 27, 2021What a moment! 💥A birdie on 18 was the only option for @KramerHickok. pic.twitter.com/5FlsGs0nnU— PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) June 27, 2021The playoff felt more like a chaotic U.S. Open than most of last week's U.S. Open did. For much of it the crowd on 18 (which was played six times!) sounded like Cameron Indoor Arena. The standard bearer for the pairing had to be replaced because of exhaustion and Hickok's buddy (and PGA Tour winner) Sam Burns was reading putts from his yardage book to Hickok's family out on the course. After both players opened with seven straight pars to start the playoff, English finally took the marathon playoff on the 8th playoff hole with the first birdie of extra time. The scorecard doesn't tell the story, though, because 14 straight 4s on two different playoff holes sounds boring, and this was anything but that.The eight-hole playoff – only the 1949 Motor City Open went longer in PGA Tour history – was not a ball-striking exhibition, but it did include eight (!!) putts made from 5 or more feet, including a 15-footer from Hickok on the sixth playoff hole and a 16-footer from English for the win. Absolute theatre. 🍿@Harris_English birdies the eighth playoff hole to claim the @TravelersChamp. pic.twitter.com/3MmLjcqpI6— PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) June 28, 2021The tide seemed to turn on every hole. When English was up against the side of a bunker on the second playoff hole after Hickok lipped out a 43-footer for birdie, it looked for certain that Hickok would win his first PGA Tour title. Then when Hickok blew his putt past the hole to 15 feet on that sixth playoff hole, English seemed just as much of a certainty. And yet, nobody could make anything but a 4 for the last 100 minutes of the tournament.Finally, English did so, and thus ended one of the more bizarre, fun moments of the golf season. This is golf. It is not a normal sport. Often, the least expected canvases provide the most interesting paintings. That's what we got on Sunday between English and Hickok, somebody nobody could have picked out of a lineup before the day started but whose name was being chanted by the end of it. Fourteen straight pars does not sound like much -- and on a Thursday afternoon it would not be -- but somehow on this Sunday evening, it was enough to deliver some of the most wonderful golf of the entire season.

Phil RodgersRick Gehman is joined by Greg DuCharme and Kyle Porter to recap the 2021 Travelers Championship. Follow & listen to The First Cut on Apple Podcasts and Spotify. Here are the rest of our grades for the 2021 Travelers Championship.Brooks Koepka (T5): Koepka actually finished third in this field on the week from tee to green but putted horribly (the worst of anyone in the top 10 on the leaderboard). He said after his round Sunday that he's going to take 10 days off from golf following a busy stretch and gave a really fascinating answer to the ubiquitous question – at least with him – "The focus and discipline is there in a major where it's not here," said Koepka. "I kind of go for everything. I'm not trying to finish second. It's just I think the majors are easier to win if you're disciplined. Out here I think there are a lot more guys that have the opportunity to win just the way it sets up. Instead of having [the pin] like three [yards] off the side, you've got five [yards]. So you got a little more room for error, and I think that's why." Grade: A-Bubba Watson (T19): Bubba led for most of the day before that late bogey-bogey-bogey-double bogey-bogey meltdown. It was tough to watch. Everything was blocked so far left, and each approach shot was seemingly worse than the one before it. He played so well all week and has been such a monster on this course throughout his career, that the finish seemed completely out of place (not to mention unexpected). It was a missed opportunity to tie Billy Casper with four Travelers Championship wins, but still mostly was a solid week for him. Grade: BDustin Johnson (T25): A strange week for D.J., who bookended a 68-65 middle of his tournament with a 70-71. The big problem for him has been with his irons. He's lost strokes in 14 of his last 27 measured rounds on approach shots, including two of four at TPC River Highlands. He was actually nearly last in the field on Sunday alone, and this after a fall in which he barely had any negative rounds on approach shots at all. To me it is pretty clearly the thing that needs fixing in his game right now.

Matt Lodge and Tevita Pangai are both unfortunately because of our salary cap and where our roster is at, we've said they can both look at options at other clubs," Walters said.Lodge put his name to some of the comments claiming Walters was a confusing communicator in the damning Courier-Mail report. Walters hinted that Pangai was likely to be behind some of the other claims that came from an anonymous source, although he added that he wasn't accusing anyone in particular of being behind the leaks out of the dressing room.Still, he was steadfast in his view that Pangai Jnr and Lodge were free to go as soon as they could find a new home, convinced that the first problem that needed to be solved was the club's bent-out-of-shape salary cap.So it came as some surprise when Walters told the media today that those players would no longer be leaving the club this season, in a move to stop the "uncertainty" affecting the players.Matthew Lodge of the Broncos (Getty)Asked specifically about Lodge, Walters replied that he'd "had that conversation and told Matt and his manager that he's not going anywhere.""He'll be staying here. We just need to get some security, some safety around the players on their futures and that's the decision we've made, so yeah," Walters said."The uncertainty was probably one of the factors among the playing group and who's staying, who's going, so we put it in a basket and put it to the side. No one's going anywhere, we're going to finish the season in a positive note, in a good note, in a winning note."He was then asked specifically about Pangai Jnr and gave a similar reply."Same. We've had those discussions with Tevita, that's ongoing. We want security and stability around the playing group and for that to happen all of that talk around who's coming and going, staying, is all pushed to the side," Walters said."It's not my concern now, my concern is to coach this team to the best of my ability.""No one is going anywhere," Walters said.Walters seemed relieved as he explained how his responsibilities had shifted due to the arrival of Ikin and the influence of new CEO Dave Donaghy, with his sole focus to be coaching, as others do the heavy lifting to fix the broken roster."As far as the roster is concerned I'm not going to make any more comments about the roster," Walters said."That's up to (Broncos elite player development manager) Simon (Scanlan), Dave (Donaghy) and Ben (Ikin) to worry about the roster. I just want to coach."He added that with the new football department personnel in place, Walters felt he had the support he needed to do his job effectively."That's the best thing. I feel as a club as a group, both the staff and the players are moving forward together," Walters said."I could see the results of the last couple of days, or certainly last week, they look really fresh now, they've had some days off, some time to reflect themselves on their season so far, and we're genuinely excited now about six games at home, some Sunday games, which I feel are going to be very beneficial for us."Walters' revelation about the Broncos' change in approach to Pangai and Lodge came following a training session that brought ex-Origin star Corey Oates in from the cold after it appeared he'd been exiled for good by the Broncos.Corey Oates at Broncos training (Getty)Oates trained on the wing and looks certain to be recalled when the team to face the Sharks is named later today."We just want Corey to be Corey Oates, the player we know he can be," Walters said."Very strong out of yardage, good carries, nice and safe and scoring tries, that's what we know he does well."For a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here!Oates a 'lost soul' after Broncos exilenrlbrisbane broncostevita pangai juniorkevin waltersmatthew lodgeMore NRL NewsPreviousEXCLUSIVE: Paul Gallen on Queensland's glaring failure in Origin II, lack of passionNextHow Queensland's dynasty sewed the seeds of NSW's fresh era of Origin dominanceMost PopularQueensland star spills beans on Green's failingsSun Yang banned from Tokyo OlympicsFootball megastar nearing $155m flopOnline Coupons and Best DealsWatch the brand new season of The Bold Type now on Stan.

HomeSportsCricketMichael Holding: 'All people of colour who hit out at racism, their careers ended in no time' Michael Holding: ‘All people of colour who hit out at racism, their careers ended in no time’Part of the fearsome West Indies quartet from the 70s and 80s, Holding is still rated as the smoothest and sharpest pacer the game has seen. Now a commentator, Holding rarely pulls his punches, whether on T20 or bad umpiring.By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Updated: June 28, 2021 10:10:55 am Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, Michael Holding’s new book, 'Why We Kneel, How We Rise', traces the history of racism and talks about the institutional and systemic discrimination against Blacks. (Illustration: Suvajit Dey) Legendary West Indies fast bowler Michael Holding talks about “institutionalised and systemic” racism in sports, insists T20 is “not even cricket”, says the Indian team has vastly improved its fitness levels and explains how Virat Kohli is similar to Viv Richards. The session was moderated by Deputy Associate Editor Sriram Veera.SRIRAM VEERA: The book is an enlightening, heart-wrenching, occasionally emotionally difficult read when you delve into the history of racism. You hadn’t spoken out a lot on this issue before last year. Why was that?Because I don’t live it. I had taken a selfish view that this is a thing I experience just for a few months when I am away from home. When I go back home, I don’t live that experience. So I just go back home, I am happy and I am content to be where I am. If you look at history, it will show you that… in the long run, it was a wise thing to do. Because if you look at all the Black people and the people of colour that have hit out against racism and made a stand, their careers ended in no time at all. Look at (American footballer) Colin Kaepernick. He is a man who in recent times took that stand. His career came to an end immediately. That shows you when Black people and the people of colour decide that they are being victimised and they want to talk about it, they want to complain about it, they want to protest about it, the system, the institutionalised racism that is evident around the world, locks you out. And you basically are dispelled from society. Perhaps that would have happened to me if I said anything earlier.https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.pngMihir Vasavada: Do you think the sports ecosystem is largely white — not the players but the administration, lawmakers, coaches, broadcasters, journalists. Everyone is white and white male at that.Racism is institutionalised and systemic. That’s what we are trying to get rid of. Thierry Henry talks about how many Black players have never been able to become football coaches. We must get rid of institutionalised racism to achieve that.Read- I don’t think I would be alive if I grew up in UK: Michael HoldingTUSHAR BHADURI: Did some people think that bowling fast and the brand of cricket that your West Indies team played at that time wasn’t cerebral enough. Was there some subtle racism?You could say there might have been some racist slant. But again, I would say those people were in a minority. Certain journalists who had certain amount of power and wrote for certain powerful newspapers would try to decry and degrade some of what we were doing. And of course people who were not really thinking for themselves and also want to find a reason to say that we were not as good will follow those journalists. But at the same time, we didn’t care. We went there to win. There is no way anyone could say we were playing outside of the laws of the game or outside of the spirit of the game. We played cricket to win and we wanted to beat everyone. Former West Indies fast bowler Michael Holding. (Express archive photo)And later on, other teams tried to adapt the same tactic which we adopted. When we started off with four fast bowlers, one of the first cries was, ‘oh it is not a balanced team’. We were winning, we were not interested in ‘balance’, we were interested in winning Test matches. In 2005, when England selected four fast bowlers and won the Ashes, they didn’t say they didn’t have a ‘balanced team’. When (Steve) Harmison hit Ricky Ponting on his face at Lord’s and brought blood, people in the stands were cheering. When we did it, it was boos and we were criminals. But when they do it, it is fine.SANDEEP DWIVEDI: The West Indies team of that era was so intimidating that other cricketers wouldn’t have dared, forget racism, to even casually sledge you guys. Somebody once used the word grovel (Tony Greig) and the world knows what happened after that. How does this dynamic work? Especially for the Asian teams of that era that have complained of racism.I have heard some members of my team say that they had racist remarks passed at them or passed around them. You know, I can’t say yes or no if that actually happened. During my entire career as a cricketer playing for the West Indies, no one on the cricket field passed a racist remark towards me. People will say because you bowled fast, they were afraid. But I don’t think that was the case. We in that team never said anything to anyone, we never abused anyone on the cricket field. Perhaps that is the reason why people didn’t really say anything to us. Because all that we did was go about our business and play as well as we possibly could. As for the Asian teams, perhaps they would have had remarks being passed at them, I don’t know, I can’t testify about something I am not aware of. But if that is the case, it is understandable because if it takes place off the field, it can take place on the field.SRIRAM VEERA: In your book, (former South African cricketer) Makhaya Ntini talks about why he didn’t get into the team bus but would run to the ground from the hotel.Yeah, he didn’t feel comfortable with the team. And he related a story that he would go for breakfast [first] and sit at a table. Other team members would come in and sit at another table. None of them would come and join him. Because of course, he was the first Black African to play for South Africa. But he was all alone at his table.You know, it is not shocking to me. When you have a country with that sort of history [of apartheid], it takes a long time for people to accept that we are all human beings. The apartheid regime doesn’t just get washed away and everything goes back to normal. It will take time for people to understand, people to accept and for people to come together.NIHAL KOSHIE: What’s your take on South African cricket’s transformation policy: six players of colour, including two Black players, are requirements. The criticism is that merit is not always rewarded.In my book, both Makhaya Ntini and I agree that a quota system is never going to be the solution. We can understand why it has taken place as people are desperate for change – and as rapidly as possible. But the best solution is to make opportunities available for everyone. I had this argument with Dr Ali Bacher from 2003 that instead of going out and picking special talent and putting them in special schools, make sure all facilities all around the country are accessible to everyone. Don’t attempt to just pick the next Makhaya Ntini. As the chapter narrates, Ntini goes to the school and gets lost. He doesn’t even know the [English] language. He doesn’t know what’s happening. Don’t take him out of his community. Go to his community and improve the infrastructure so that they can develop themselves. It’s a lot easier on them that way because you are putting pressure on them when you take them out of their community. And of course, you will identify more talents; instead of picking one, you might get 3-4. Ntini might bring along a kid from his community who is good. That is the best way to get to where you want to be – getting the best to be selected. Michael HoldingThe quota system just shows that you are in a hurry to be where you want to be. In my opinion, that should not last. You can’t keep on having a quota system forever and forever. Ntini talks about it – he is in the South African team and is being looked at as a quota player instead of being justified of his place. He was mentally strong and able to get over it. Not everyone is going to be like that, though. It can destroy your mind.SANDEEP DWIVEDI: What do you think about the West Indies of today? We hear youth’s love for basketball and then they win a T20 tournament and again talks of cricket revival begin. But it doesn’t last long. Why?When you win a T20 tournament, that is not revival; it’s not even cricket! It’s going to be very difficult for the West Indies to get on top in Test cricket because of this T20. The T20 tournaments around the world are the bane of the game. When you are a poor country and can’t afford to pay as much as England, Australia, and India, the players will go on to play T20. That’s where West Indies and others are getting hit. Unless you can pay as much as the rest of the big countries, this will happen. Many West Indies players are not interested in playing for West Indies. I don’t want to call out names. When you are earning 600,000 or 800,000 dollars for six weeks, what are you going to do? I don’t blame the cricketers. I blame the administrators. They give a lot of lip service to Test cricket but all they are interested in is bringing in money into their cupboards… West Indies will win T20 tournaments which aren’t cricket; they won’t be a force in Test cricket.SANDEEP DWIVEDI: You haven’t found commentating in IPL interesting?I only commentate on cricket.SHIVANI NAIK: When your team bowled bouncers, the administrators changed rules. Now things have changed with the episodes of concussions and their long-term effects. Would you say cricket should relook that part of the game or continue with it?What I’ll tell you is that I’m glad I’m on the way out. Because they are slowly but surely destroying the game. I wouldn’t even try to honour that with a proper response. You want to cut out bouncers from the game? Okay, well, stop footballers from heading the ball because that gives them concussion as well. And that is a study that has proven to be correct. You try and protect people as much as you can, yes, that is why people are wearing helmets and improving helmets now. That is why they do so much to try and protect them because people’s lives are important. But don’t turn it into a softball competition. Cricket also is a test of your strength of character. What you have got ticking inside your chest. That is why they call it Test cricket. If you’re afraid of the ball, why should you be able to excel when you’re afraid? So if you’re a coward, find another way to make a living.SANDIP G: Do you think batsmen are reluctant to play the hook shot these days? More batsmen seem to be getting hit these days.If you can’t hook, you don’t hook. You have too many people who cannot hook but are trying to hook because they have a false impression that their helmet will protect them. Years gone by, before the helmets came along, people who could not hook didn’t try to hook because they knew if they made a mistake, it could be a dangerous mistake. If you’re playing on a normal, plain surface and getting hit, it obviously means – 1) You’re not capable of playing the game that you’re trying to play or 2) You’re playing shots that you’re not capable of playing. Look at the history of the game. How many people got hit before helmets came along?SANDEEP DWIVEDI: This whole shrinking of cricket that is happening… Looking at the bigger picture of Zimbabwe, even Sri Lanka, South Africa. There was a point when there wasn’t so much money but cricket was active in so many countries.Michael Atherton wrote an article about it many years ago. He thought Test cricket would die and I said, ‘No, Test cricket won’t die in my lifetime but it will become more and more insignificant.’ England, they say, is the mother of cricket where the game started before all the colonialists took it around the world. The best months in England are supposed to be the summer months, right? Is yearly Test cricket being played? They play in May and early June. The next Test match is on August 4. This has been going on for two-three summers in England. So, it’s obvious that they are putting other forms of cricket over Test cricket. The shortest form of the game is attracting more and more people and companies to broadcast them. Test cricket just gets lip service.SRIRAM VEERA: India, England and Australia have got power in cricket. You think they are using their power well? Some in India say the white guys used to run it and now it’s our chance. Even if we do something bad, let it be because they used to do it for so long, so let’s show them who is boss now.The great Nelson Mandela was in jail for 27 years and when he became president of South Africa, if he had adopted that same attitude of ‘Okay. It’s my time in power. I will do to you what you did to me,’ South Africa would have been in a bloodbath. Great people don’t think that way.Think of cricket as a universal game. Not something owned by India. We saw the big three of England, Australia and India trying to take over the game and they did for a period of time. They are still doing it but doing so undercover. It’s obvious that they are only interested in themselves. The same attitude that you talk of… ‘Oh we have the power. We will do as we like,’ it pervades the game.Read- People won’t understand how it feels to face racism throughout your life: Michael HoldingSANDEEP DWIVEDI: Is there a significant difference in the way India plays cricket now and in the past?Well, it’s a totally different era when it comes to Indian cricket. When I played against India, probably two of the players were fit. Now everybody on the field is fit. You see how athletic they are, how dynamic they are. The skill level hasn’t really changed that much but when you have fitness, and change of attitude along with skill level, obviously the cricket will also change. What has also helped Indian cricket is that a lot of pitches in India, for domestic cricket and cricket in general, have improved. The ball bounces a lot more and since it carries, batsmen are able to cope on overseas pitches. In my time, once India left India, that was it. The pitches that they played in India were slow and low and it became dusty. When I did a series in India in 2014-15, when West Indies came and the tour was abandoned, each time I would do a pitch report with Sunny Gavaskar, I would joke and say, ‘Sunny, how come the pitches weren’t like this when we used to play here?’ Good pitches create good cricketers.SRIRAM VEERA: What are your thoughts on Virat Kohli, his approach and his captaincy?Virat Kohli is someone who wears his heart on his sleeve. He’s someone who will let you know exactly how he feels. I think he gets a bit carried away at times, but that is Virat Kohli, that is the man. He’s similar to Viv (Richards) in that regard. Viv, sometimes on the field, was over-expressive. But those are the personalities of those two gentlemen. They can tone down a little bit as well, but then, if you are a Mustang, it’s hard to tell a Mustang to trot. He’s going to gallop.As far as his captaincy, I’ve only seen India when they were touring England and I saw them in South Africa. The only thing I’d say about Virat is that he tone down a bit so his team can relax because a lot of them, I think, are on tenterhooks.SHAHID JUDGE: What do you think about social media-related problems players face?When people talk about social media putting them under stress, all they need to do is to come out of social media. Social media is now being monetised. More people are following you on social media, people are telling me, the more advertisers you get, more money goes to your pocket. I was never interested in what the newspapers were writing or what the journalists were saying. And up till now, I have never joined a social media platform. I am not interested in that.DEVENDRA PANDEY: These days commentators are under pressure since their fate is being decided by cricketers and cricketing boards. How do you maintain your honesty and self-respect as a commentator?You know what the situation is going to be when you are working in India and for the ICC — what you can and cannot say. I accused some umpires of bad umpiring during the World Cup, that was the first time I worked for an ICC tournament for something like 10 years because they don’t want people to express the opinion they don’t like. Because that is the way they want to control the narrative of what is going on. They want people who will say what they want. I am not into that. I am here to give an honest opinion of what is taking place on the field because I have my integrity to live up to and that’s the only thing that I can take to my grave. I can’t take money or love or anything else to my grave but name.SHAMIK CHAKRABARTY: How hopeful are you that things will change with regard to racism?This is not going to be an easy read for anyone. My sister called to say that some chapters are difficult to read. It had to be a hard read because unless you recognise why you are sick, you can’t cure yourself. It was both cathartic and emotional and at times difficult to write. Because there was a lot in the book that I didn’t know… I had to go and research. I saw some pictures from the 40s and 50s about what they did to people. They did really degrading things to Black people.I have hope that people are waking up. A few days ago, I was on Good Morning Britain (GMB) and I spoke up about all this. And this gentleman and his wife, a white English couple, slipped a note under my door. I will read it to you: “Dear Michael, just saw your interview on GMB. So very passionate and empowered, very eloquent. It has opened our eyes. Thank you very much.” I know there is a chance of things getting better. We have a chance. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

He's one of the best halves in the game.But Cherry-Evans is not on the level of Cleary, who is the best player - let alone halfback - in the world. Blues fullback James Tedesco is a very close second and Tom Trbojevic is up there too.For a guy that touches the ball so much and makes so many crucial decisions, no one can tell me Cherry-Evans is better than Cleary.Nathan has the ability to elevate the players around him, much like the greats of the game in Andrew Johns and Johnathan Thurston.Match Highlights: Maroons v BluesThink about what they did for their teammates - Thurston boosted Gavin Cooper from the Cowboys into the Maroons side.Teams feed off their main playmaker and Nathan relishes that responsibility. He's always got a cool head.Cleary needed to own an Origin series, and while he might not have got the praise received by Turbo, Tedesco or Latrell Mitchell, he's been outstanding.Fittler brimming with pride over historic defensive effortWhile Cleary and Jarome Luai look so comfortable with each other, what we saw from Queensland was a lot of overcalling in game two.The Maroons weren't on the same page and their attack looked disorganised. Their plans would have been disrupted by Reece Walsh's withdrawal late in the week, but with three premiership winners in their spine, you'd expect them to adjust on the run.Queensland didn't have a commander in chief - they all were waiting around for someone else to do something.We can't let their halves off lightly. Cameron Munster could become one of the all-time greats, but he lacked direction on Sunday night. The same goes for Cherry-Evans, who didn't show his leadership qualities.Last year Munster bounced in off the back of the Storm's premiership win and with everyone writing off the Maroons, they probably felt like they were playing with house money as they caused a boilover.But I think coaching has been the big difference in 2021.Freddy Fittler knows his NSW squad now. He learned a lot about himself last year and was humble in defeat. He started working straight away, and Origin's about preparation and timing it just right.Blues turn attention to emulating 2000 sideI can't help but think that Queensland got it wrong with hiring Paul Green to take over Wayne Bennett as the coach. It was a weird one considering they had Billy Slater, who I think is one of the best thinkers ever, especially of the younger brigade.Bennett's influence on the series has still been apparent. He got Mitchell cherry-ripe for NSW through coaching the Rabbitohs.The series is gone, but the Maroons have everything to play for in game three because it can mean so much for the next 12 months.Contract kerfuffle: Green outlines events leading up to Mulitalo's exitThey can go into enemy territory and stop the rot now, chalk up the first two games as bad nights and start building for 2022.But if they come down and get rissoled, the talk about a Blues dynasty will gain momentum because NSW will be hungry for success.Still, you don't want to be arrogant in predicting the future.Munster cruelled by not icing opportunitiesIt was only six months ago that everyone was wondering how NSW lost that series to Queensland, and we had a lot of the same players in key positions including Damien Cook, Tedesco and Cleary.However, if the Blues ever wanted to turn the tide after Queensland's unprecedented success from 2006-2013, they've started the right way.I expect the Maroons will make a few changes. Kalyn Ponga should come in if he's fit and Valentine Holmes needs to go back to the wing.Thurston laments Maroons lost Origin momentsAnd they need to find another centre. I love Kurt Capewell, but it's so unfair watching him try to mark Trbojevic. Even though he's done an admirable job, that's just not his position.Most of all, Queensland need to find some heart. They haven't been the passionate side that I grew up watching or that I played against.Regardless of the changes they make, it's attitude that requires fixing.
