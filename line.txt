Insurance company Aviva, which buys leaseholds from house builders, will repay homeowners who saw their ground rents double. Campaigners for leaseholders said the commitments were a "massive milestone".The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched its investigation into leaseholds in 2019 because it was worried that leaseholders were facing huge and unexpected increases in the cost of buying a freehold or massive increases in ground rents. It said the said the commitments by Persimmon and Aviva were a "real win".CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said the watchdog now expected other housing developers and investors to take similar action. "This is a real win for thousands of leaseholders - for too long people have found themselves trapped in homes they can struggle to sell or been faced with unexpectedly high prices to buy their freehold. "But our work isn't done. We now expect other housing developers and investors to follow the lead of Aviva and Persimmon. If not, they can expect to face legal action."What is a leasehold?With a leasehold, the person owns a lease which gives them the right to use the property. But they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes.When a leasehold flat or house is first sold, a lease is granted for a fixed period of time, typically between 99 and 125 years, but sometimes up to 999 years - although people may extend their lease or buy the freehold.But leasehold house owners are often charged expensive ground rent as well as fees if they want to make changes to their homes. A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell.Under the new commitments Aviva will remove ground rent terms the CMA considers unfair and repay homeowners who saw rents doubled.In a statement Aviva said it had voluntarily agreed to amend a "small proportion" of leases it had acquired with terms which cause rents to double every 10 or 15 years. The agreement affected about 1,000 leases or just over 2% of those held by the fund. The CMA's George Lusty told the BBC: "If Aviva is now the freeholder for your property and your lease contains a term that doubles the ground rent every ten or 15 years, that doubling won't apply, so you'll just pay the initial ground rent that you signed up to at the beginning and if you've already started to pay an increased fee, they'll refund that."image copyrightGetty Imagesimage copyrightJo Darbyshire Jo Darbyshire, a co-founder of the National Leasehold Campaign, originally had a ground rent that doubled with developer Taylor Wimpey.She bought the house near Bolton in 2010 for £400,000 - and two years after that Taylor Wimpey sold the leasehold to Adriatic Land, now held by a division called Longharbour."The price to buy [the freehold] absolutely rocketed from £5,000 to £50,000 and it has since come down to £30,000."Jo says she used Taylor Wimpey's ground rent assistance scheme which was £750 towards expenses and she didn't have to pay to have the lease converted from the one which had doubled to one that converts to rises linked to RPI inflation.She is now planning to speak to her solicitor to work out whether her best option is to try and buy the freehold at the original price or lower. "It's good that Aviva has set this precedent, but whether or not [the firm that holds my] freehold will join them is another question," she adds. Taylor Wimpey said: "We will continue to engage with the CMA and, as previously announced, we will work with them to find a satisfactory resolution."Claire Stevens, from Lancaster, bought a £190,000 Persimmon property in 2017 and bought the freehold in 2019 for £3,750 - which 25 times the ground rent. She said she rang the helpline today to ask if she could expect a refund of £1,750 but they didn't know."We bought the freehold for house as soon as we could," she says. "I hope that this is a genuine offer, not just a ploy to stop them being investigated further," Claire adds.Fair dealPersimmon Homes has extended its existing Right to Buy scheme to cap the purchase price of a freehold at £2,000. It said the extended scheme applied to any leases sold on or after 1 January 2000 and would run until 31 December 2026.It said customers who had already acquired their freeholds from Persimmon under the existing Right to Buy scheme, and who still own the freehold, could apply to be reimbursed for the difference between the price paid and £2,000.Persimmon group chief executive Dean Finch said the agreement showed the company's "determination to operate with integrity". "Building on our existing Right to Buy scheme, this agreement provides a fair deal for all leaseholders of Persimmon built houses, extending the opportunity to purchase their freehold at a price well below market value."

"We'll absolutely make sure that they stick to that and of course we're prepared to intervene again through court action in necessary to make sure they stick to what they've committed to do." The National Leasehold Campaign, many of many of whose members gave evidence to the CMA, tweeted that the watchdog had secured "landmark commitments for leaseholders. Another massive milestone. Persimmon & Aviva have eventually done the right thing at last, now other developers & freeholders MUST FOLLOW." The CMA launched enforcement action against four housing developers in September 2020. In addition to Persimmon, these were Countryside Properties, Taylor Wimpey and Barrett. It has also been investigating investment firms Aviva, Abacus Land, Adriatic Land and Brigante Properties which bought leasehold contracts from Countryside and or Taylor Wimpey. Investigations are continuing into all of them except Persimmon and Aviva. The watchdog is taking a drip-drip approach in this long-running investigation. They are hoping that getting a few companies to agree to change their ways will pressure others to do the same without the need for costly court cases. It's not an easy task because there are now a lot of players in this market. The big developers began the trick of sneaking high ground rents into contracts, often without flagging it to buyers. But over time some of these lucrative contracts have been sold on to investment companies looking to profit from them. The pension firm Aviva owns just under 10% of those problematic contracts, with charges that double within 15 years. Their change of heart will certainly have a big impact on the 1,000 homeowners who have been paying the exorbitant bills, but it doesn't fix the problem for the other 12,000 households struggling to pay increasing ground rent on top of their mortgages.The government says it planning to ban ground rent from future contracts, but that won't help those who have an existing problem, unless the watchdog does more to force other builders and investment firms to change their contracts too.Mr Lusty said: "We hope today's announcement will send a clear signal to other housing developers and investors that they need to sort out this really difficult issue for leasehold home owners."The government, which asked the CMA to carry out the investigation, welcomed the agreement.Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said the settlement with Aviva and Persimmon was a "hugely important step and demonstrates our commitment to support existing leaseholders who may have been mis-sold properties"."We have also introduced new legislation that will protect future homeowners by restricting ground rents in new leases to zero and I would strongly urge other developers to follow suit in amending their historic practices."Mike Amesbury MP, Labour's shadow housing minister, said the change was welcome but "further highlights the injustice faced by homeowners already trapped in our feudal leasehold system". He said: "The government has long promised reform, but their upcoming bill is a missed opportunity to help existing leaseholders... The Government must go further and faster to help existing leaseholders."Are you a leaseholder? Does this agreement affect you?

Monday MalaysiaCorporateCourt Top StoriesHighlight KPMG says audit was proper and will contest Serba Dinamik’s suit — but can a company sue its auditor? Adam Aziz/theedgemarkets.comJune 23, 2021 15:51 pm +08According to Serba Dinamik, KPMG did not respond to the company for over eight weeks after informing that it will pause its audit until Serba Dinamik conducts an independent review of the findings. (Photo by Mohd Izwan Mohd Nazam/The Edge) -A +A KUALA LUMPUR (June 23): The audit-turned-legal tussle between Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd and KPMG has raised questions of whether a company can sue its auditor if the latter reports possible discrepancies to regulators.Depending on the severity of the audit issues flagged by KPMG, the auditor’s action is guided by the Capital Markets and Services Act.Under Section 320 of the Act, auditors are required to report to the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) and the exchange any cases that adversely affect to a material extent the financial position of the public listed company (PLC), or any breach of securities laws and rules of the exchange.And if they do so, they will enjoy legal protection in their employment and also be protected from being sued by the PLC.The saga was made public when Serba Dinamik on May 25 notified Bursa Malaysia that KPMG had red-flagged certain bills and transactions in its 12-month period ended Dec 31, 2020 to the tune of over RM4 billion.After making several board changes and expressing plans to undertake an independent review, Serba Dinamik pulled a surprise yesterday by filing a civil suit against KPMG for alleged negligence, breach of contract and breach of statutory duty.Earlier today, KPMG said the audit was still being conducted in accordance with the relevant professional standards, and that it will vigorously contest any court proceedings.At yesterday’s press conference, Serba Dinamik executives claimed that the issues could have been resolved if KPMG took steps to meet its clients and look at alternative procedures to determine the amount disputed.Serba Dinamik’s legal counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah also expressed that the company's relationship with its auditor is no longer tenable, and that KPMG should resign.According to Serba Dinamik, KPMG did not respond to the company for over eight weeks after informing that it will pause its audit until Serba Dinamik conducts an independent review of the findings.“We found no infringement of law or non-compliance with provisions,” said Muhammad Shafee. “The key content is missing for KPMG to do whistle-blowing to the SC. As a result of unfavourable red-flagging of issues, the SC acted purely on what KPMG said and raided the premises of this company.”Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Sections 430 and 120 of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) by-laws states that a litigation between an auditor and a client will likely deter the accountant from acting objectively, and may only be addressed by ending the relationship.This may be why Serba Dinamik decided to sue KPMG instead of trying to remove it via a shareholders' meeting as earlier planned.But the MIA by-laws are said to be merely a code of conduct and it is not clear that given the gravity of the matter, the resignation of KPMG will resolve the core issues facing Serba Dinamik.Read also:Serba Dinamik to take legal action against external auditor KPMG for alleged negligenceNo basis for legal action, says KPMG on Serba Dinamik suit SC says Serba Dinamik probe ongoing and auditors must do their work without fear or favour Serba Dinamik now says its board will meet on Friday to decide on independent review scopeSelling persists as Serba Dinamik sues KPMG for alleged negligence Subscribe to Mid-day email alertWe deliver news to your inbox daily Featured Videos 28 Jun | 06:30amMorning Call, FeaturedMORNING CALL: 28/06/2125 Jun | 09:03pmFeatured, Evening 5EVENING 5: Serba Dinamik’s directors resign, share price tanks25 Jun | 06:30amMorning Call, FeaturedMORNING CALL: 25/06/2124 Jun | 09:24pmEvening 5, FeaturedEVENING 5: KPMG resigns as Serba Dinamik’s external auditor24 Jun | 06:30amMorning Call, FeaturedMORNING CALL: 24/06/2123 Jun | 08:50pmNews, FeaturedNEWS: Sunway talks plans post-GIC’s investment23 Jun | 08:29pmEvening 5, FeaturedEVENING 5: GIC invests RM750mil in Sunway Healthcare23 Jun | 06:30amMorning Call, FeaturedMORNING CALL: 23/06/2122 Jun | 09:28pmNews, FeaturedNEWS: ‘KPMG is like a shoplot auditor’22 Jun | 08:58pmNews, FeaturedNEWS: Serba Dinamik maintains no wrongdoing Most ReadMost Watched 1 Continued profit growth fails to support Serba Dinamik share price, why? 2 Serba Dinamik plunges to new all-time low as investors weigh directors’ resignation over KPMG lawsuit disagreement 3 After govt extends first phase of recovery plan, FMM questions rationale of key indicators needed to transition to next stage 4 Phase One of National Recovery Plan to be extended, says PM Muhyiddin 5 Interstate, interdistrict travel still restricted in PPN Phase Two 2021-06-25Evening 5, Featured 2021-06-27Featured, Morning Call 2021-06-22Featured, News 2016-11-08Featured 2021-06-24Featured, Morning Call Branded ContentRichWorks aims to guide 10,000 entrepreneurs to achieve RM1 million a year in annual salesZTE Corporation is at the forefront of 5G-powered transformationKick-start your investment journey with HLeBroking campaignCloud accounting is the next big step in a business' digital transformation journeyUnderstanding the needs of the banked and the underbanked in the finance sectorPost-pandemic recovery amid rising inflation e-Paper Desktop ReaderHomeAbout UsJoin UsContact UsAdvertise with usSubscriptionSitemapTerm of usePDPAStart DateEnd DateCopyright © 1999-2021 The Edge Communications Sdn.

share optionsShare this onFacebookTwitterLinkedInSend this byEmailMessengerCopy linkWhatsAppPrint contentPrint with images and other mediaPrint text onlyPrintCancelAn agricultural development project in the Northern Territory has had its 10,000-megalitre water allocation revoked in a decision ultimately made by the Territory's Health Minister because the Water Security Minister had a conflict of interest.Key points:A 10,000-megalitre water allocation for irrigation in the NT has been revokedNT's Health Minister was required to make the final decision because its Water Security Minister declared a conflict of interestMeanwhile, NT Farmers say the decision is not based on science and hope the project can happen one daySo what happened?Last year, the NT Land Corporation opened expressions of interest (EOI) for a 5,700-hectare agricultural precinct at Larrimah, about 180 kilometres south of Katherine.The advertisement described the area as having "a unique seasonal advantage for crops such as mangoes, citrus, and melons" and by the time the EOI closed in February, it had attracted interest from "several parties".It also attracted the interest of the Northern Land Council (NLC) and the Environment Centre NT, which sent submissions to the Territory government questioning the water allocation.This triggered an independent review that then led to the Health Minister's final decision, made just last week, to cancel the water licence.Paul Burke, chief executive of the NT Farmers Association, described the decision as being the result of "an unfortunate chain of events" and said it was the first time a water licence such as this one had been overturned."The scientific data doesn't support [the water licence being cancelled], but that's the decision that's been made, and we need to work through how to ensure it doesn't happen again in the future."This land doesn't have a lot of potential without water."Top scientists not impressedThe NT Department of Environment and Water Security had spent years doing soil and water testing in the region.Speaking to ABC Rural, the department's executive director of water resources, Amy Dysart, said the decision was disappointing."We stick by the science within the department and we're confident in the decision that was originally made by the NT's Water Controller," she said."So, while we are disappointed with the review's outcome, there are matters this process has raised which we can improve and address."Based on the aquifer characteristics … the water is available for use in that area."According to a departmental report, the Larrimah project would have required 0.06 per cent of the area's calculated groundwater storage.Get the latest rural newsVisit ABC Rural for agriculture and mining news, including weather and the marketsSign up for Rural RoundUp: Stories from rural and regional Australia, in your inbox every Friday, or for Rural news daily.Why Health Minister made decision Northern Territory Health Minister Natasha Fyles stepped in to make the decision to revoke the allocation.(ABC News: Nicholas Hynes)According to a statement from NT Health Minister Natasha Fyles, she was put in charge of the decision because the Environment and Water Security Minister, Eva Lawler, "declared a conflict of interest due to her oversight of the NT Land Corporation"."Therefore, I acted as a delegate and made a decision based on advice I received," Ms Fyles said."In this transitional zone, [where the Larrimah project is located] the advice I have been given is that the appropriate approach likely needs to be determined on the basis of the specific aquifer characteristics, and these criteria need to be more explicitly defined in guidance material to support the Water Allocation Planning Framework."In a statement, chief executive of the NLC, Marion Scrymgour, said she applauded Minister Fyles' decision to overturn the licence."Clearly the original decision made by the Acting Water Controller was incorrect," she said. "We have dodged a bullet that could have had detrimental impacts for generations to come. "We had concerns the decision was not based on the best available scientific information and that it would be unsustainable in the long-term – creating risks to all Territorians."Posted 4ddays agoWedWednesday 23 JunJune 2021 at 7:40am, updated 3ddays agoThuThursday 24 JunJune 2021 at 9:19pmShareCopy linkFacebookTwitterArticle share optionsShare this onFacebookTwitterLinkedInSend this byEmailMessengerCopy linkWhatsAppRelated StoriesFarmers 'extremely limited' after groundwater requests knocked back Northern Territory set to release 67,500 hectares for farming near WA-NT borderMore on:LarrimahDarwinAlice SpringsKununurraWater ManagementIrrigationAgricultural CropsState and Territory GovernmentRuralTop StoriesLive: National Cabinet to meet this afternoon as states battle unfolding outbreaksWhat just happened?

FTA, llamada popularmente Manbang en su mercado nacional, recaudó el martes casi 1.600 millones de dólares al ofrecer 82,5 millones de ADS en su debut, cuyo precio se situó por encima del rango previamente anunciado.Se espera que esta cantidad sea superada por la mayor empresa china de transportes por carretera, Didi Chuxing, que podría recaudar hasta 10.000 millones de dólares en su gigantesca venta de acciones prevista para este año.FTA también recaudará un total de 200 millones de dólares del inversor estatal de Abu Dhabi, Mubadala, y de la Junta del Plan de Pensiones de los Profesores de Ontario mediante la venta de acciones ordinarias de clase A. La empresa se formó en 2017 a partir de una fusión entre las plataformas digitales chinas de transporte de mercancías Yunmanman y Huochebang.

Thanks for reading and for your comments. Alex Druce will be back in the driver’s seat tomorrow. Good night. 5.16pm on Jun 23, 2021Markets wrap: COVID, EOFY lead bourse lower By Lucy BattersbyAn end of financial year portfolio shuffle and the worsening COVID outbreak in Sydney saw the Australian stock market take a negative turn on Wednesday, even after a strong lead from Wall Street and positive performances in major Asian bourses.The local banking sector weakened and dragged on the rest of the market with the big four banks all closing in red.The S&P/ASX 200 ended the day 0.6 per cent lower at 7298.5 points, dipping below 7300 for the second time this week.Health sector heavyweight CSL fell 2.1 per cent to $294.25 and is down $10 over the past three sessions. Pro Medicus fell 5.3 per cent and Mesoblast dropped 3.1 per cent.Travel stocks were also under pressure as a COVID outbreak in Sydney attracted new interstate travel restrictions.Flight Centre fell 3.5 percent, Webjet fell 2.3 per cent, Sydney Airport fell 2.2 per cent. Major miners made gains with BHP up 1 per cent, Rio Tinto up 0.7 per cent, and Fortescue up 0.5 per cent.Locally, the Commonwealth Bank’s economists predicted the RBA would start raising rates next year, rather than 2024, because the economy was recovering faster than expected.Morgans senior client advisor Simon Ferguson said the cash rate would have to get substantially higher for investors to move money out of equities and back into bank deposits.“You will get some exodus from day traders (as soon as it starts to rise), but for real investors that won’t be enough,″⁣ Mr Ferguson said.“Retirees really need to see 2 to 3 per cent on their cash deposits and even that is still historically low. I think they are comfortable enough to be in equities”.Australia’s subdued performance contrasted with positive sessions on Wall Street after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank was comfortable with a temporary spike in inflation.But US-based RBC Capital Markets chief US economist, Tom Porcelli, said he saw some cracks among the central bank members with two others saying inflation was already at the target.“If we are reading between the lines of (Loretta) Mester’s responses today, she may well be one of the seven officials looking for a hike in 2022,” Mr Porcelli wrote in a note to clients.“If that guess is right, that would mean at least two voting members are in the 2022 hike camp (Mester and James Bullard). That could make the voting dynamic pretty interesting next year.”He described Jerome Powell’s testimony as “an hour-long political commercial” and “a bit cringe-worthy to be honest”.Among the biggest moves on the ASX200 was an 8.5 per cent jump in Washington H Soul Pattinson to an all-time high of $33.08 after announcing yesterday it would merge with Milton Corp. 4.32pm on Jun 23, 2021Freelancer drops for session - but still up 100+ per cent this year By Emma KoehnShares in jobs marketplace Freelancer dropped by close to 20 per cent on Wednesday, finishing the session 16.1 per cent lower at $1.04.The company filed a notice with the ASX on Tuesday confirming the cancellation and buy-back of 937,500 shares in accordance with the company’s employee share plan.Freelancer's Matt Barrie says the pandemic fueled the gig economy as more workers find themselves out of a job.Credit: “There was no cash outlay by the company for the buy-back of the [employee share plan] shares as loans were made by the company to employees to fund the original purchase of shares,” Freelancer said in a statement.Shares in the freelance platform are down 6 per cent over the past month but have gained 135 per cent over the past year, with the share price below 60c last March, just before the COVID pandemic began.Advertisement 4.21pm on Jun 23, 2021ASX200 finishes with 0.6 per cent drop The S&P/ASX200 has ended Wednesday’s session down 43.7 points or 0.6 per cent to 7,298.5. The market’s losses widened in late afternoon trade as banks, healthcare and travel stocks dipped and Sydneysiders faced new coronavirus restrictions after 16 local cases.CSL shares finished the session down 2.1 per cent after a downgrade of the stock by Citi, ending Wednesday at $294.25. The biggest winner of the day in percentage terms was Washington H. Soul Pattinson, up 8.5 per cent to $33.08 after news this week of a merger with Milton Corp. 4.07pm on Jun 23, 2021Another major outage at CBA By Tim BiggsCommonwealth Bank has experienced its second widespread outage within a week, as its merchant terminals and online banking failed at around 1.30pm this afternoon, leaving businesses unable to process payments and consumers unable to access funds.As of 3:00pm a spokesperson for the bank said its merchant terminals were beginning to come back online and process payments, but it was still looking into the interruption to its web- and app-based banking systems.CBA confirmed an outage to its online services this afternoon. Credit:Josh Robenstone“We are aware some customers may be experiencing some difficulties logging on to NetBank and the CommBank app right now. We are urgently investigating this and we’re sorry for any inconvenience caused,” the spokesperson said.The problems follow a broader outage of many major banks on Thursday, which was caused by an issue at cloud services company Akamai. However the most recent interruption appears to be specific to Commonwealth Bank. 3.53pm on Jun 23, 2021Liberty ups guidance By Emma KoehnNon-bank lender Liberty Financial Group has upped earnings guidance, telling investors it now expects net profit after tax and amortisation to come in at $220 million for 2021. The numbers reflect “better than expected trading performance” since the company’s February update. The company estimates a final unfranked dividend of 24c per share. Liberty listed on the ASX last December after a $320.7 million IPO raise with shares at $6.00. Shares were down 1 per cent in late afternoon trade to $7.78.

The company was just waiting for a stronger price signal, according to Chief Executive Officer Duncan Craib, who said he was confident market dynamics were moving in the right direction.“There is significant uncovered demand in the coming decades -- and post-2023, primary supply to meet that demand is severely limited,” Craib said in a phone interview. He was seeing most interest from potential buyers in the US, which accounted for over 20 per cent of global uranium demand, but was also in talks with utilities in Europe and Asia. Australia is the world’s third-largest uranium producer after Kazakhstan and Canada.Uranium prices have languished since the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan saw nuclear power fall out of favour with energy planners. Now nuclear is cautiously making a comeback -- with the White House arguing it should be one of the power sources eligible for a national clean energy mandate as part of President Joe Biden’s ambitious climate goals.Boss’s study used a uranium base case price of $US60 a pound over an 11-year mine life, well above current contract prices in the high $US30s, based on its expectations for tightening supply, declining stockpiles and the global emissions-driven push for carbon-free fuels. Their view is backed by the federal government, which sees uranium spot prices rising steadily to an average $US52.40 a pound in 2026, according to a March report.“We’re already seeing more interest from utilities in spot and long-term contracting,” said Craib. “We see activity picking up in the third quarter and continuing into the next calendar year.” The recent tie-up between Sprott Asset Management and Uranium Participation to set up a trust to buy physical uranium would further stoke demand, he added.Read the full story here. 3.32pm on Jun 23, 2021Hong Kong residents fear losing access to bank accountsBy Denise Wee and John ChengHSBC Holdings Plc apologized to customers in Hong Kong after an update to its online and mobile banking terms stoked fears over overseas access to its services in the financial hub.The quick mea culpa by Hong Kong’s biggest bank -- triggered by a Twitter post -- underscores growing concerns in the city over not only civil society but also pressures on businesses as China tightens its grip.Banks are trying to navigate an increasingly fraught political environment. The government last week used them as a hammer to shutter the city’s premier pro-democracy newspaper, Apple Daily, ordering seven lenders against dealing with the company. The lenders haven’t been identified. Access to funds in the city is becoming a sensitive topic with thousands of Hong Kongers leaving for the U.K. and other places as freedoms are restricted.Against that backdrop, the city’s residents were spooked after a Twitter post on Tuesday shared a link to updated online and mobile banking terms on HSBC’s website. The bank announced changes to its terms from July 26.It said customers may not be able to use online or mobile banking outside of Hong Kong.The incident was widely reported by major local newspapers, including Ming Pao, Sing Tao Daily and Hong Kong Economic Times. On LIHKG, one of Hong Kong’s largest online forums, a post on HSBC has more than 800 comments since late Tuesday, with some people saying they would transfer funds to other banks.HSBC was quick to reassure customers that there were no changes and that it only had combined terms for its internet banking, mobile app and mobile security key into one document.“HSBC Hong Kong customers can continue to access banking services through Online Banking and Mobile Banking outside of Hong Kong SAR,” a spokeswoman said.“There is no plan for any amendment of the services. There are similar cross border disclosures in other markets.”The bank also issued a “Special Announcement” on its mobile app, saying there were no plans to change services.Analysts at Bank of America Corp. have estimated that emigration-related outflow of money to just the U.K. could reach HK$280 billion ($36 billion) this year, and HK$588 billion over the next five years.Bloomberg 2.45pm on Jun 23, 2021Vocus volumes jump on arbitrage, profit takingBy Lucy BattersbyVocus trading volumes have jumped this week up from an average of 3 million shares per day to 13.7 million on Monday, 16 million on Tuesday, and 26 million so far today.The reason is a 1¢ arbitrage for those who can be bothered - the difference between today’s price of $5.485 and the $5.50 that shareholders will received from bidder Voyage Australia, a joint venture between Macquarie Group’s infrastructure arm MIRA and Aware Super. Shareholders voted 99 per cent in favour of the takeover at a meeting on Tuesday. But investors do not get that $5.50 price until 22 July, so anyone who wants to take their profit before the end of 2020-21 will be selling this week.The stock will also be removed from the S&P/ASX 200 list at the end of this week, which forces any fund managers with mandates for shares in ASX200 to exit their position.Advertisement 1.26pm on Jun 23, 2021Vote this afternoon on inquiry into anti-money laundering By Charlotte GrieveLabor senator Deborah O’Neill is calling for an inquiry into Australia’s anti-money laundering regime to probe the regulators, laws and private companies tasked with stamping out financial crime.The proposal will be voted on around 4pm today, has support from independent senators and Senator O’Neill is actively negotiating for support from One Nation. (It is listed as the item before Senator Jacquie Lambie moves to have Christian Porter’s behaviour examined by the Finance and Public Administration References Committee.) Senator O’Neill has proposed a motion to establish a formal inquiry through the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, chaired by Kim Carr, that would examine the “adequacy and efficiency” of the regime.Senator Deborah O’Neill and Labor MP Daniel Mulino in Canberra on Wednesday. Credit: Alex EllinghausenCasinos and banks are among the companies required by law to detect and report suspicious transactions and customers to the financial crime regulator - the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC).AUSTRAC has had a string of recent high-profile victories, including fining Westpac $1.3 billion and the Commonwealth Bank $700 million after systemic non-compliance with these laws enabled serious and organised criminals to use the country’s major banks.In both cases, Senator O’Neill said AUSTRAC heavily relied on tip-offs or self-reporting and called for a closer look at how the regulator operates and whether it is appropriately resourced.“AUSTRAC seems to think they’re doing fine. I don’t think that’s the case,” she said.The federal government has promised to introduce reforms to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act since 2006 which would force lawyers, accountants and real estate agents to report suspicious transactions in the same way banks and casinos do.The proposed inquiry would look at why these reforms have taken so long to implement, but also call on business groups to establish a roadmap for ensuring any new regulations don’t hurt small businesses.Fellow Labor MP Daniel Mulino, who is also pushing for the inquiry, said Australia’s current financial crime regime was regarded as a laggard internationally and immediate work was needed to ensure the regime is world class.“It’s critically important Australia’s anti-money laundering regime is up to scratch so we don’t become the weakest link,” Mr Mulino said. “We’ve fallen behind a number of jurisdictions.“Latest1 of 4OldestLatestOldestMost Viewed in BusinessLoadingAdvertisementBack to topThe Sydney Morning HeraldTwitterFacebookInstagramRSSOur SitesThe Sydney Morning HeraldThe AgeBrisbane TimesWAtodayThe Australian Financial ReviewDomainTravellerGood FoodDriveCarAdviceRSVPClassifiedsTributesCelebrationsPlace your adCommercial Real EstateOneflareThe Sydney Morning HeraldContact & supportAdvertise with usNewslettersAccessibility guideSitemapPhoto salesPurchase front pagesContent licensingOur eventsWork with usConditions of usePrivacy policyPress CouncilProducts & ServicesSubscription packagesMy accountSubscriber FAQsToday’s PaperDaily CrosswordsCopyright © 2021FeedbackSubscribe

Here's what they're buying insteadPublished Wed, Jun 23 20213:08 AM EDTEvelyn Cheng@chengevelynShareShare Article via FacebookShare Article via TwitterShare Article via LinkedInShare Article via EmailKey PointsThis cycle of Chinese regulation on technology giants will likely last for a few years, Lucy Liu, a BlackRock portfolio manager, said during a mid-year Asia investment outlook.As a result, the firm is staying away from the stocks of dominant tech companies for a while longer, she said.The U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba are down about 9% so far this year, while those of Hong Kong-listed Tencent are up about 3%.A CCTV security camera is seen in front of the Alibaba Group headquarters on April 10, 2021, in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province of China.Long Wei | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesBEIJING — The Chinese government's crackdown on big technology companies will likely last for a few years, which means those stocks aren't a buy for now, a BlackRock portfolio manager said Wednesday.Since autumn, regulators have ramped up scrutiny on the country's tech giants such as Alibaba and Tencent. After years of relatively unrestrained rapid growth, becoming some of the biggest companies in the world, the corporations now face fines and new rules aimed at curbing monopolistic practices."This regulatory cycle is long-lasting compared to 2018," Lucy Liu, portfolio manager for global emerging markets equities at BlackRock, said during a mid-year Asia investment outlook event.In contrast with that period of increased scrutiny, which ran for about six months to a year, she said that this time, "we think it's going to be a multi-year cycle."VIDEO2:3202:32Here's why China's crackdown on crypto mining could be good for bitcoinCryptoBlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is neutral on Chinese stocks overall, and only recommends buying specific sectors or stocks.In tech, Liu said the big companies' earnings are affected not just by regulation but also competition. She noted new trends in e-commerce have prompted companies to invest more in infrastructure, which has a lower initial return on investment.As a result, BlackRock plans to "stay a little bit away from the large, dominant platforms for a little bit longer," Liu said.Chinese tech stocks have generally traded lower over the last several months. Some of the stocks briefly rose in April after news that Meituan and some other tech companies had issued pledges to comply with anti-monopoly rules.Read more about China from CNBC ProJPMorgan picks its favorite Chinese stocks on everything from hydrogen to EV batteriesJim Cramer says he feels better about Apple's China exposure after Nike earningsChina's Gen Z are set to spend big – analysts pick 3 stocks that could be winnersWhat BlackRock is buyingInstead, Liu said the firm prefers small and mid-sized internet companies since they have less exposure to regulatory risks and could still see significant user growth.She particularly likes companies operating in areas such as short video and livestreaming. Liu did not name specific stocks in her presentation.One of the few publicly listed Chinese short video companies is Kuaishou, up about 70% since its IPO in February but down roughly 25% over the last 60 trading days.The stocks of Chinese tech giants are among the largest publicly traded companies in the world.For example, Tencent is the largest stock listed in Hong Kong by market capitalization, worth roughly the equivalent of $716.63 billion. Its shares are up about 3% so far this year.The U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba are down about 9% during that time.Subscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockAdvertise With UsJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Under the partnership, Cisco will deploy its Ultra Packer Core to Vi’s network architecture which will enable the telco to deploy innovative new software applications and services, including voice-over-WiFi (VoWiFi). Cisco’s offering will also enable Vi to leverage functions such as automation and analytics, the statement added. "We are committed to providing seamless connectivity to our customers and enhancing user experiences, empowered by an intelligent and automated network," said Jagbir Singh, Chief Technology Officer, Vodafone Idea Ltd. "As part of our digital transformation journey, we are happy to partner with Cisco to bring innovative new services to more people in the digital era.""Vi is committed to delivering best-in-class services to their subscribers and bridging the digital divide that separates urban from rural areas… This is a significant step forward in India's transformation journey. It puts Vi in a strong position to take advantage of the future opportunities that 5G, cloud and IOT Services will bring, supporting critical industry sectors such as healthcare and education,” said Adam MacHale, Vice President of EMEAR Service Provider, Cisco.This comes close on the heels of Airtel’s strategic partnership with Tata Group to deploy Open-RAN-based 5G radio and core solutions, which the latter has developed locally.The Sunil Mittal-led telco said that it will pilot and deploy this indigenous solution developed as part of its 5G rollout plans in India and start the pilot in January 2022.Airtel and market leader Jio have already leaped ahead of Vi in the 5G race.Read also5G subscriptions to reach 330 million by 2026 in India: EricssonAirtel made its 5G trial network live in Gurgaon’s Cyber Hub in the Millennium city while Jio switched on its 5G trial network in Mumbai, ET reported recently. For this, Airtel has deployed Swedish Ericsson’s 5G telecom gear but Jio has gone ahead with its indigenously developed 5G equipment and technology.Vi though is yet to undertake its 5G network trial. The Mumbai-based telco has been reiterating that its network is "future-ready" for rolling out 5G services. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had recently allocated 5G trial spectrum in the 700 MHz, 3.5 GHz and 26 GHz bands to Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea (Vi) to develop India-relevant use cases on the next-gen fast wireless broadband technology.The telecom department had recently asked Indian telcos to conduct trials in rural, semi-urban settings and urban settings so that the benefit of 5G technology proliferates across the country and is not confined only to urban areas.With 5G trials, the DoT said that it aims to test various use cases such as telemedicine, tele-education, augmented/ virtual reality, and drone-based agricultural monitoring.Follow and connect with us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedinIndustryVodafone IdeaVodafone Idea Ltd.Vodafone Idea Cisco partnershipVodafone Idea 5Gtelecom newsNEW DELHI:CISCO5g network5G Recommended by ColombiaSponsored StoriesSubscribe to our Newsletters250000+ Industry Leaders read it everyday How did you hear about us?

Naspers owns 100% of Takealot.News24 quoted Sgourdos as saying perishable goods will be something new for Takealot and a “completely different category of goods to its current operations”.“The expansion will probably have to be organic, but it is certainly attractive,” he said.Delivering groceries will be a completely new category for Takealot, but it is not too far away from what it is already doing.Through Mr D Food, Takealot provides a convenient way for South Africans to order food from restaurants.The company has the IT infrastructure and logistics in place to deliver products fast and affordably to consumers and expanding into perishable goods is, therefore, a natural evolution to grow its ecommerce presence in South Africa.Takealot will face stiff competition in this market, though. Checkers, Pick n Pay, and Woolworths have excellent ecommerce operations with growing support.These retailers are investing heavily in their ecommerce capabilities and their platforms – Checkers Sixty60, PnP Bottles, and Woolies Dash all offer excellent service levels.While it will enter a hotly contested space, Naspers, through Prosus, is well-positioned to help Takealot offer grocery deliveries in South Africa.Prosus has investments in many prominent food delivery platforms including iFood, Delivery Hero, and Swiggy.“While food delivery is one of the key pillars of the Prosus strategy, we expect to see an evolution to a broader on-demand delivery ecosystem,” Prosus said.The company’s focus is now to extend beyond restaurants to convenience, grocery delivery and logistics.“All our food delivery businesses have rolled out convenience and grocery delivery,” Prosus said.In January 2021, Prosus extended its presence in this field through an investment in Helsinki-based delivery platform Wolt.Wolt started with restaurant deliveries but has moved into delivering products from grocery stores and local shops to homes and offices.In April 2021, Prosus made its first direct investment in an online grocery business, Norwegian-based Oda.This followed with an investment in Germany-based instant grocery delivery company Flink in June.With these investments through Prosus, it is clear that Naspers believes grocery deliveries are a growth area.Just like with their international food delivery businesses, it will make sense to extend Mr D’s operations to convenience and grocery deliveries.Takealot has experienced exceptional growth over the last year, increasing its revenues by 65% to US$606 million (R8.7 billion).The company — which includes Takealot.com, Superbalist, and Mr D Food — also reported Gross Merchandise Value growth of 84%. This represents the total value of sales made through its platform, including third-party sellers.Mr D Food delivered particularly strong results as consumer demand shifted from in-restaurant dining to online delivery.Mr D Food’s order volumes grew 117%, resulting in a 103% growth in revenues year on year.This growth has helped Takealot to reduce its trading loss from US$43 million (R618 million) to US$7 million (R101 million) over the last year.US$6 million of this trading loss came in the first half of the financial year during which the hard lockdown hurt online retailers. In the second half of the year, the loss narrowed to US$1 million.Takealot is therefore set to make a profit for the first time since it launched a decade ago.Takealot financesNow read: Takealot made R14.66 billion in sales over the last yearBasil Sgourdos Headline Mr D Food Naspers Prosus takealot Share on Facebook Share on TwitterShare your thoughts: Takealot may start to sell groceries Subscribe to our daily newsletterSubscribe Latest news New Level 4 lockdown rules — what you can and can’t do Alcohol banned and schools closed as South Africa moves to level 4 lockdown Bitcoin exchange Binance banned in UK Partner Content Synology unveils major updates to DSM and C2 Unique challenges facing young entrepreneurs in South Africa The Top10 – An easy fix to a complex market Show commentsJoin the conversationAutoload commentsComments section policy: MyBroadband has a new article comments policy which aims to encourage constructive discussions.

With states now easing restrictions, economic activity in May is likely to signify the trough. Moneycontrol News June 23, 2021 / 12:19 PM IST Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday slashed India's growth projection to 9.6 per cent for 2021 calendar year, from its earlier estimate of 13.9 per cent, and said faster vaccination progress will be paramount in restricting economic losses to June quarterIn its report titled "Macroeconomics – India: Economic shocks from second COVID wave will not be as severe as last year's, Moody's said high-frequency economic indicators show that the second wave of COVID-19 infections hit India's economy in April and May. With states now easing restrictions, economic activity in May is likely to signify the trough."The virus resurgence adds uncertainty to India's growth forecast for 2021; however, it is likely that the economic damage will remain restricted to the April-June quarter. We currently expect India's real GDP to grow at 9.6 per cent in 2021 and 7 per cent in 2022," Moody's said.Earlier this month, Moody's had projected India to clock a 9.3 per cent growth in the current fiscal ending March 2022, but a severe second COVID wave has increased risks to India's credit profile and rated entities.Indian economy contracted by 7.3 per cent in fiscal 2020-21 as the country battled the first wave of COVID, as against a 4 per cent growth in 2019-20.Close Related stories In charts | India’s COVID-19 case count, state-wise trends, vaccination data, and other key detail...COVID-19 Update: When can kids go back to school? AIIMS director Randeep Guleria has an answerHaryana government extends lockdown till July 5: What is allowed, what is not Stating that stringent lockdowns in economically significant states will mar April-June quarter economic activity, Moody's said the 10 states that have been hardest hit by the second wave collectively account for more than 60 per cent of the pre-pandemic level of India's GDP.Four states - Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka - contributed the largest shares among all states in financial year 2019-20.Moody's said faster vaccination progress will be paramount in restricting economic losses to the current quarter. As of the third week in June, only about 16 per cent of the population had received one vaccine dose; of those, only about 3.6 per cent had been fully vaccinated."Mobility and economic activity will likely accelerate in the second half of the year as the pace of vaccinations pick up. The government recently announced a strategy to centralise vaccine procurement in order to boost vaccinations, which if successful, will support the economic recovery," it added.Moody's expects the overall hit to India's economy to be softer than that during the first wave last year. However, the pace of recovery will be determined by access to and delivery of vaccines, and the strength of the recovery in private consumption, which could be hampered by the deterioration of balance sheets of low- and middle-income households from job, income and wealth losses.India's second wave peaked in the beginning of May; since then, new cases and daily deaths have continued to fall, and the number of people who have recovered from the virus has exceeded the number of new infections since mid-May.India’s total tally of COVID-19 cases crossed the three-crore mark with 50,848 new cases reported in 24 hours. The death toll climbed to 3,90,660 with 1,358 fresh fatalities."We assess the overall economic effect of the second wave to be softer than that during the first wave of the pandemic last year, although delivery of and access to vaccines will determine the durability of the recovery," Moody's added.(With PTI inputs) Moneycontrol News TAGS: #Economy #India #India growth #Moodys first published: Jun 23, 2021 12:23 pm Watch Aswath Damodaran, 'Dean of Valuation' , take on markets, cryptos, IPO on Moneycontrol's Masterclass EP10 Watch more Why crude oil will not hit $100 Watch more RIL's Digital push, green energy expansion & transformation roadmap Watch more Ideas For Profit | Betting On Associated Alcohol's Strong Earnings Record, Well-Run Biz Watch more Must Listen The Private Market Show | Syndicates are disrupting early-stage startup investing: Arun Tadanki stay updated Subscribe to our Daily Newsletter submit Get Daily News on your Browser Enable Trending news Delhi govt further eases curbs from June 28: Check what's allowed, what isn't Last week in pictures: Take a look at some of the most stunning images from around the world The young Indian chef taking the ‘world’s best butter chicken’ global Dalal Street Week Ahead: Here are 10 key factors that will keep traders busy next week Moody's cuts India growth forecast for 2021 to 9.6% E-commerce companies pose risks to livelihood of millions of people:...

Picture: TwitterSource:TwitterKISS FM radio host Kyle Sandilands spent a good chunk of his morning show trying to hunt down an in-demand item sold at Woolies. The product is Tip Top’s new Cinnamon Donut Loaf and Kyle is desperate to try it.It’s so popular that a Woolworths spokesperson said it’s “flying off the shelves” – which is probably why Kyle struggled to find it.He spent an hour and a half on Tuesday night driving around to find a Woolies that stocked it – but sadly failed in his endeavours.Instead, he and co-host Jackie O appointed a staffer to line up at a local Woolies store before it opened to make sure he was first to nab the sweet loaf, but he also failed.RELATED: $3 Woolies item ‘you need to try’Kyle Sandilands is on the hunt for a Tip Top Cinnamon Donut Loaf sold at Woolies. Picture: TwitterSource:Twitter“This is bullsh*t,” Kyle said before calling the Macquarie Park Woolworths store in Sydney.“We went to get someone to get it, every store gets one loaf, we were first in line and the loaf was already gone,” he told the Woolies worker on the phone.“Are you sure someone hasn’t thieved it because it’s very desirable?” he asked.The staffer responded that she’s not even sure her store has received the item, to which Kyle said: “I need this loaf”.And to be fair, it does sound pretty amazing.“This scrumptious loaf is soft in a middle but also crunchy on the outside when toasted. Each slice is slightly sweetened and made with delicious bursts of Cinnamon flavour,” the product description reads.But a Woolies spokesperson told news.com.au current stock does vary by store and they’re working closely with Tip Top to increase supply as soon as possible.“So customers will see wider availability over coming days through next week,” he said.Due to its popularity, Woolies is struggling to keep up with demand. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied“Since launching in our stores last week, the new Cinnamon Doughnut Loaf has been flying off our shelves.“Cinnamon flavours have been popular with our customers recently, especially in cereals, and this new scrumptious loaf is already a hit in many of our stores.”However, things could have looked very different for Kyle had he known Coles also sells the loaf.“We’re excited to stock the Golden Cinnamon Donut Soft Loaf at all Coles supermarkets across the country,” a Coles spokesperson told news.com.au“We’ve seen more than twice the amount sold yesterday compared to other breakfast lines which shows just how much customers are loving the new flavoured loaf.”It’s no surprise it’s such a hit with shoppers flooding social media about the tasty treat.“Needs it! So much for losing weight,” one person wrote on Facebook, while another added: “Omg you’re kidding”.Sounds scrumptious indeed. Picture: SuppliedSource:SuppliedIt is expected to be available for the next 12 months in Woolies stores across the country – except in Tasmania and the Northern Territory, where the item isn’t available at all.But news.com.au can confirm Coles is making it part of their permanent range, with the item also sold for $5.“This better live up to its name because I am telling you, this is going go off if it actually tastes like a cinnamon donut,” Jackie said on air.trending in lifestyle2379Lockdown: ‘Embarrassing’ reason we’re back to Covid, circa M...682Tiddlywink stuck up NZ woman’s nose for 37 years208Standard clothing sizes: Woman’s viral rant after large biki...200Victoria’s Secret model Bridget Malcolm shares tiny bra she ...85Non-alcoholic beverages exploding in popularity in AustraliaShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailRelated topicsWoolworthsBack to Top MORE IN foodBig change coming to Macca’s‘Crazy’ shelf detail stuns Woolies shopperSubway hits back at ‘fake tuna’ claimsMcDonald’s grilled over shaker friesFind usAdvertiseAbout UsNewslettersPremium membershipDownload the AppPrivacy PolicyRelevant Ad Opt-OutCookie PolicyTerms & ConditionsOur TeamCouponsLicencingConnectA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

Skanska's Flex-it policy supported a return to full productivity, brought significant mental health and wellbeing benefits for staff And some data from the 18-month trial shows adjustments to working patterns could drive savings on labour costs due to enhanced productivity.BAM Construct, BAM Nuttall, Skanska UK and Willmott Dixon took part in the trial that re-designed shift patterns in onsite roles to enable more flexible working.The pilots organised by flexible working consultant Timewise ran between June 2020 and February 2021 in several locations, from a HS2 site in London through to a substation build near Weston Super Mare, among teams employing between 14 and 120 workers.Workers involved reported a strong jump in a sense of well being, with those who thought their working hours gave them enough time to look after their own health and wellbeing rising from 48% to 84%.Overwork decreased with those that said that they regularly worked beyond their contracted hours falling from more than half, to just over a third (51% to 34%).At the start of the trial, nearly half of all participants felt guilty if they started later or finished earlier than others onsite. This portion decreased to a third (47% to 33%).Adrian Savory, CEO for BAM Nuttall said: “The results of the pilots have demonstrated flexibility for operational roles is possible, and has been a win, win, win – for the business, teams and improving individual’s wellbeing.“We have started implementing the approach across the whole of our business. And it’s encouraging to see people having conversations that wouldn’t have been possible without these results and the clear guidance for a successful approach. ”Rick Lee, chief people officer at Willmott Dixon said: “The scheme has allowed us to progress our pre-existing agile working programme and has helped us develop our knowledge and skills to enable our people, whether they have a site or office based role, to achieve a greater work/life balance.”“Being able to embed a successful approach to agile working at our sites is critical for achieving a diverse business and realising our aim to achieve gender parity across our workforce by 2030.”Andrea Singh, HR Director for BAM Construct UK, said: “Thanks to this pioneering work, our managers are thinking differently and that’s making a real improvement to people’s lives. We now ask, ‘how can we make flexibility work?’ and not, ‘can we make it work?’. Managers are finding flexible approaches that work for their team and clients.” Shift-life balance – different flexible working approachesBAM Construct: team-based approach to flexible working. Tested setting shifts that takes workers’ personal preferences into account, similar to work Timewise has conducted with nurses in the NHS.BAM Nuttall: flexi-day approach. Workers could accumulate additional hours in exchange for one day off each month.Skanska UK: earlier starts and finishes – Skanska UK trialled two different approaches with two different teams on HS2, both revolving around earlier start and finish times:Output based: Site supervisor works with a planner to develop a more detailed version of the schedule of work, broken down into weekly and daily objectives. Working hours are set, based on the outputs to be achieved each day.Staggered: Site supervisor alternates start times between the teams each week, so that all workers get the pattern they want every other week. In addition to this, workers are given a choice of break times.Willmott Dixon:Limit hours worked to 45 per week inclusive of breaks, and to ensure that an agile working plan is in place for all teams and on all new projects.

Bitcoin, a synonym of cryptocurrency, has witnessed widespread adoption this year. Companies such as Tesla, JPMorgan, Paypal, etc. have started accepting Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies for payments.Due to the high market volatility, the value of any cryptocurrency is never stable. Despite this, Bitcoin hit an all-time high in March to US$60,000. Until recently, Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies were viewed as a store of value. However today, it is used in many places as a form of crypto payment, thereby promoting a crypto world. TOP 10 CRYPTOCURRENCIES TO BUY ON JUNE 23THE MOST POPULAR CRYPTOCURRENCIES IN JUNE 2021TOP 5 CRYPTOCURRENCIES TO BUY THIS WEEKEND FOR HIGH RETURNS Elon Musk earlier announced in February that he will accept Bitcoins as a payment method for Tesla, which he revoked due to the hazardous environmental effects of Bitcoin’s mining. He is still considering its decision if Bitcoin works around sustainability concerns.Microsoft also is encouraging payments in Bitcoin to provide extra value to its users’ accounts. With Microsoft, you can redeem Bitcoin as credit, which you can use for a variety of services such as Skype, Xbox Live, OneDrive, Microsoft 365, etc.PayPal also announced in April its PayPal Bitcoin initiative that encouraged the easy purchase of Bitcoin cryptocurrency and accepting crypto payments. Moreover, you can also hold and buy Ethereum and other assets in its wallets on PayPal.Further, recently PayPal along with other investors – Bessemer, Initialized Capital, Jump Capital, Salesforce Ventures, Operator Partners, Blockchain Capital, and executives from Google has invested in TRM Labs, leading a US$14 Million Series A funding round.TRM Labs is cryptocurrency compliance and risk management platform that helps financial institutions to act on opportunities related to cryptocurrencies by offering solutions that mitigate the risks associated with them. PayPal’s investment in TRM Labs shows the enthusiasm of the company towards a crypto-driven economy.Other companies that accept cryptocurrency are in the food industry. like Starbucks, Burger King, etc. are also accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as payment. Burger King partnered with Cryptobuyer that converts cryptocurrencies to normal currency. Following Burger King, Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut have embraced cryptocurrencies as payment. Coca-Cola is also accepting crypto payments in a partnership with Centrepay.You can play on Twitch, Amazon’s live-streaming platform, by paying in Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. You can pay Bitcoin to buy subscriptions to multiple streamers, with Twitch’s in-game currency – Bits.While Covid-19 had put the travel industry at a standstill, cryptocurrency is trying to change the entire landscape of this industry. Flight companies, vacation service providers, travel companies accept cryptocurrency payments.For example, Flight Centre is accepting Bitcoins for payments using Bitpay. Expedia is also taking Bitcoins through a collaboration with Coinbase.Ecommerce giants like Amazon and eBay are not completely accepting cryptocurrencies as payment, you can still send Amazon vouchers and gift cards through Bitrefill. Rumors are steaming in the air that eBay will accept crypto payments in the future. Shopify will also allow merchants using a Shopify store to pay with crypto.Beauty brands such as Lush will accept crypto payments on websites. Rakuten, a Japanese eCommerce brand, is allowing customers to pay with cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.Does all of this indicate that we are moving towards a crypto-driven world? We cannot determine that at the moment because the crypto market is highly unpredictable. Nonetheless, we can still expect more developments in the crypto space.

Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe has hired Citigroup Global Markets to manage the sale of the shares."Today's announcement marks the start of a phased exit from the State's remaining investment in Bank of Ireland,” Minister Donohoe said.“When all cashflows are taken into account the taxpayer has already recorded a surplus on its investment in and support for the bank, even before the sales of these shares are accounted for. A trading plan enables the State to sell down its shares in a low cost carefully controlled manner while avoiding the need to try to time our disposals with market conditions,” he added.The Department of Finance is being advised by N.M. Rothschild & Co and William Fry in relation to this transaction.Francesca McDonagh, CEO of Bank of Ireland, said the move by the Government is “a positive step - for Irish taxpayers, the Irish economy, and Bank of Ireland.”“Today's announcement commences a process which will add to the returns already received, and also marks an important moment in normalising the relationship between the Irish State and Bank of Ireland," Ms McDonagh added.Business NewsletterRead the leading stories from the world of business.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign UpMore to followLatest IrishNew senior management take reins at Horseware RTÉ, Virgin Media and TG4 join forces to voice concerns about place on digital platforms AIB clears competition hurdle in Goodbody deal Irishman’s UK biotech startup backed by billionaire Retirement funds claim proposed fee hike could cause employers to question pension costs Most ReadHeineken sets sights on Guinness market with launch of new stout New senior management take reins at Horseware Multi-millionaire Declan Kelly reduces Teneo work after drunken antics at charity event Retirement funds claim proposed fee hike could cause employers to question pension costs Declan Kelly: Millionaire PR mogul used to fixing clients’ problems, now Tipp man has to fend for himself LatestPat StaceyOpinion Two series on Sophie’s murder offer up damning insights but actual evidence is in short supply Four rescued by coast guard helicopter after girls swept out to sea in inflatable dinghy 23 arrested in London after Extinction Rebellion dumps manure outside Daily Mail offices Cristiano Ronaldo's Euros dream ends as Thorgan Hazard screamer sees Belgium edge Portugal Conor McGregor reveals he plans to open an international pub chain Independentie SearchSearch NewsIrish NewsWorld NewsLocal NewsEnvironmentWeatherLatest NewsVideoTopicsOpinionLettersEditorialCommentBusinessBudget 2021BrexitIrishWorldTechnologyPersonal FinanceSmall BusinessFarmingJobsCommercial PropertyIn The WorkplaceSportEuro 2020RugbyGAASoccerOlympicsThe Left WingThe Throw InWomen's SportGolfHorse RacingOther SportsDublin GAATee to GreenLifeHealth & WellbeingHome & GardenFamilyParentingFood & DrinkMotoringStyleCelebrityFashionBeautySex & RelationshipsVoicesGalleriesEntertainmentMoviesTelevisionMusicRadioBooksTheatre & ArtsGamesFestivalsPuzzlesHoroscopesTravelReader Travel AwardsTravel NewsStaycationsIrelandReviewsWalksEuropeWorld/USATravel TVCruiseSkiPodcastsNew Irish WritingThe Left WingThe Big Tech ShowReal Health PodcastGoing to CollegeThe Throw InThe Floating VoterWomen in TechAbout UsVideoNewsletterChoosyJellow.ieIndependentShopDiscount CodesSocialsFacebook Twitter Email SitemapContact UsTerms & ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with Us A Mediahuis Website © Independent.ie Privacy

That's a U-turn from Tuesday, which saw bitcoin (XBT) plunge below $30,000 for the first time since late January.The cryptocurrency has lost almost half its value since it hit an all-time high in April. Other currencies have experienced similar price swings. Ethereum and dogecoin each rebounded about 4.8% and 8.9% respectively on Wednesday, after getting caught in the selloff earlier this week.Read MoreThe value of crypto has seesawed dramatically this year for a range of reasons, including concerns about the environmental impact of mining coins and increasing government scrutiny.Coinbase plunges along with bitcoin and the rest of cryptoChina, in particular, has for months been aggressively pushing to curtail use of virtual currencies, and has intensified its crackdown on both mining and trading over the last few days. On Monday, the People's Bank of China said it had summoned Alipay, the widely popular online payments platform run by Jack Ma's Ant Group, along with five big lenders and told them to "comprehensively investigate and identify" cryptocurrency exchanges and dealers so they could cut off any crypto trading.The lenders included the Industrial and Commercial Bank (IDCBF), the Agricultural Bank of China, China Construction Bank (CICHF), the Postal Savings Bank of China and the Industrial Bank. The development sparked a sharp 12% fall in bitcoin over a 24-hour period. Bitcoin plunges below $30,000 as China ramps up the pressure on cryptosOver the weekend, Chinese state media reported that Sichuan, a southwestern province of China, had ordered a halt to all crypto mining operations and to cut off the power supply to many mining facilities. Sichuan is a major hub for bitcoin mining.Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda, noted the increased pressure in China in a report to clients this week."Bitcoin needs to expedite transitioning mining out of China," he wrote. "Bitcoin remains trapped in the $30,000 to $41,000 range, but downside risks are catching the eyes of everyone." — Laura He contributed to this report.SearchWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUnited KingdomUS PoliticsThe Biden PresidencyFacts FirstUS ElectionsBusinessMarketsTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideosHealthLife, But BetterFitnessFoodSleepMindfulnessRelationshipsEntertainmentStarsScreenBingeCultureMediaTechInnovateGadgetForeseeable FutureMission: AheadUpstartsWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryBeautyVideoTravelDestinationsFood and DrinkStayNewsVideosSportsFootballTennisGolfOlympicsUS SportsClimbingMotorsportFormula EEsportsVideosLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsHLNTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZCNNVRFeaturesAs EqualsCall to EarthFreedom ProjectImpact Your WorldInside Africa2 DegreesCNN HeroesAll FeaturesWeatherClimateStorm TrackerWildfire TrackerVideoMorePhotosLongformInvestigationsCNN ProfilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNNFollow CNN BusinessMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

SubscribeThe Guardian - Back to home NewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleShow captionMock up products, showing how a Foundation Earth score will appear in the September pilot programme. Food & drink industryTraffic-light system of ‘eco-scores’ to be piloted on British food labelsUK government and major brands back bid to help consumers assess environmental impact of productsNosheen Iqbal @nosheeniqbalSun 27 Jun 2021 07.30 BSTShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailA new traffic light system on food and drinks packaging is being launched to allow consumers to make more environmentally friendly choices.The scheme has been put together by Foundation Earth, a new non-profit organisation backed by the government, global food giant Nestlé and British brands including Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s, the Co-op and Costa Coffee.A pilot run in the autumn will see a range of food and drink carrying front-of-packaging “eco scores” for the first time, ranking the environmental impact of each item and allowing customers to easily assess whether they are buying goods that have a low-carbon footprint from suppliers focused on sustainability.The labels are expected to shake up the supply chains of the food and drinks industry and encourage producers to be more innovative in helping reduce their environmental impact. Products will be graded into tiers marked A to G and colour-coded, with green reserved for the most environmentally friendly items and red for the least, based on a system developed by food scientists at Oxford University with support from World Wide Fund for Nature.Food production is a major contributor to carbon emissions and biodiversity loss. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the industry is responsible for up to 37% of greenhouse gases, and that without intervention this is likely to increase by 30% by 2050 due to population growth.The launch of Foundation Earth has brought together key players from food science, food production and retailing, and is being partly funded by the European Commission’s food innovation initiative EIT Food.Andy Zynga, chief executive of EIT, said: “Foundation Earth is the culmination of years of work from our EIT Food consortium and from the likes of Oxford University. It will bring a credible and clear front-of-pack labelling system on food products right across the continent.”The traffic light pilot will run in parallel with a nine-month research project that will combine the Oxford method with a programme devised by Belgium university KU Leuven and Spanish research agency AZTI to produce an eco-score system fit for use across Europe by 2022.Foundation Earth was the brainchild of entrepreneur Denis Lynn, who died in a quadbike accident last month. Lynn’s firm Finnebrogue Artisan owns bacon brand Naked, which will join Meatless Farm, Greencore, Mash Direct and the Good Little Company in adding eco-scores to their products from September.Labour MP Luke Pollard, the shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, said: “People want to do what they can to tackle the climate crisis and help the environment. But at the moment they don’t have the information they need to make more sustainable buying choices. I want to see clearer labelling on carbon and environmental credentials so people can back the brands and products doing the right thing by our planet.”Climate crisis to hit Europe’s coffee and chocolate suppliesTopicsFood & drink industryThe ObserverFoodAgriculturenewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on WhatsAppShare on MessengerView on theguardian.comShow moreShow moreShow moreShow moreAbout usContact usComplaints and correctionsSecuredropWork for usPrivacy settingsPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersModern Slavery ActDigital newspaper archiveFacebookTwitterAdvertise with usSearch jobsPatronsDiscount CodesSupport The GuardianContributeSubscribeBack to top© 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

On Thursday, a driver plowed through a chain-link fence at a FedEx cargo facility and went onto the airfield, crossing runways as police chased the car.Police said the driver was detained, and no injuries were reported.

New York’s attorney general suggested the pharmaceutical giant was pushed.Either way, the American drug maker is the first to formally agree to get out of the multibillion-dollar business of selling the powerful narcotic painkillers that drove the US opioid epidemic.Johnson & Johnson pays $230m to settle New York opioids caseJ&J made the deal, along with agreeing to pay a $230m settlement, to avoid the first jury trial of major pharmaceutical companies over the opioid crisis, which is scheduled to open in New York state on Tuesday.The trial comes as the drug industry faces a reckoning for what its accusers describe as cynicism and greed in creating an epidemic of addiction to prescription painkillers and illicit opioids, such as heroin, that has killed more than 600,000 since 1999 and caused misery for millions more.Ongoing trials in West Virginia and California have pressured J&J, other opioid makers, pharmaceutical chains and some of the largest US drug distributors into settlement talks amid shocking revelations about their business practices.A trial of drug distributors accused of illegally flooding West Virginia with opioids and driving the highest overdose rate in the country revealed that executives circulated rhymes and emails mocking “pillbillies” who became addicted to painkillers.That trial is one of a series of bellwether cases to establish whether opioid makers, distributors and pharmacy chains are liable to pay out billions to thousands of counties, cities and Native American tribes harmed by opioids. Another trial, involving two Ohio counties, was settled minutes before it was to begin with four big drug companies agreeing to pay $260m.J&J did not admit liability in settling the New York suit brought by the state and two Long Island counties. It said its “actions relating to the marketing and promotion of important prescription pain medications were appropriate and responsible”.But the risks of going to a full trial were clear after a judge in Oklahoma found against the company two years ago after weeks of testimony, which revealed a pattern of disdain among employees toward the risk of addiction from powerful painkillers and contempt for those who became hooked.In one company memo, a rep said she dismissed a doctor’s fears patients might become addicted by telling him those who didn’t die probably wouldn’t get hooked.Consultants hired by J&J recommended its sales force focus on increasing sales by looking to “target high abuse-risk patients (eg males under 40)”.The judge ordered J&J to pay $465m in restitution after finding that it deceptively and aggressively pushed false claims that its powerful opioid painkillers were safer and more effective than they were. He also found that the company made “substantial payments of money” to front organisations to resist curbs on prescribing.The New York case threatened further embarrassing revelations for a company that has sought to restore its reputation after other scandals, including over contaminated baby powder, with its anti-Covid vaccine.New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, heralded the settlement as not only providing funds to repair some of the damage caused by the epidemic but cutting off a path to addiction.“Johnson & Johnson helped fuel this fire, but today they’re committing to leaving the opioid business – not only in New York, but across the entire country,” she said.J&J said it had already decided in 2020 to “discontinue all of its prescription pain medications in the United States”.Big pharma executives mocked ‘pillbillies’ in emails, West Virginia opioid trial hearsIf the decision was indeed made last year, then it came not long after Oklahoma judgment.The New York trial will go ahead against other drug manufacturers and distributors. The state also sued Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, the drug widely blamed for kickstarting the opioid epidemic, but that has moved to a separate bankruptcy court.Other drug firms will be closely watching what the jury decides, along with the verdicts in West Virginia and California, to decide whether it is worth pressing on in court or finally reaching a comprehensive agreement to settle more than 3,000 cases.One indicator of which way they think the wind is blowing is that some drug makers and distributors have told shareholders they have set aside billions to settle cases.Chris McGreal is the author of American Overdose, The Opioid Tragedy in Three ActsTopicsOpioids crisisOpioidsPharmaceuticals industryNew YorkanalysisShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on WhatsAppShare on MessengerView on theguardian.comShow moreShow moreShow moreShow moreAbout usContact usComplaints and correctionsSecuredropWork for usPrivacy settingsPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersModern Slavery ActDigital newspaper archiveFacebookTwitterAdvertise with usSearch jobsPatronsDiscount CodesSupport The GuardianContributeSubscribeBack to top© 2021 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

StartupsTechnologyMENAbytes LiveAbout UsSocial MediaContact Us MENAbytesStartupsTechnologyMENAbytes LiveAbout UsSocial MediaContact Us InvestmentsDubai’s Eyewa raises $21 million Series B to expand its omnichannel platform for eyewear By Zubair Naeem Paracha Posted on June 27, 2021 - Like & Follow Us Follow @MENAbytes ShareTweetShareWhatsAppEmail0 SharesDubai-headquartered eyewear startup Eyewa has raised $21 million in a Series B co-led by Kingsway Capital and Nuwa Capital, it announced in a statement today. The deal was also joined by French Partners, Endeavor Catalyst, Derayah Ventures, Palm Drive, and Hardy Capital, and takes Eyewa’s total capital raised to date to about $30 million. It had previously raised $7.5 million Series A in 2019 and $1.1 million in a seed round in 2018.Mehdi Oudghiri and Anass Boumediene who previously led Foodpanda in the Middle East started Eyewa in 2017 with the aim to build the largest tech-enabled eyewear company in the region. It started as an online retailer selling sunglasses, contact lenses, and prescription glasses in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and has now evolved into an omnichannel player that also features in-house brands. Its ecommerce platform now also sells to customers in Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait. The startup told MENAbytes that it has doubled its year-over-year revenue in the ongoing quarter.Eyewa kicked off its retail expansion earlier this year by opening its first brick-and-mortar store in Dahran, Saudi Arabia. It has since opened two more stores in Jeddah and plans to add many more across all the major cities in Saudi and UAE in the next few months.The move may have come as a surprise for many in the region as it’s very rare to see online players here expand to offline. For Eyewa, however, it was the plan from the very beginning, “It has always been part of our vision to eventually become an omnichannel retailer,” its co-founder and CEO Mehdi Oudghiri told MENAbytes. Explaining why they’ve been interested in going offline, he said, “We want to be as close as possible to our customers. We started as an ecommerce company because that is where the biggest market gap was, as no one was offering high-quality and affordable eyewear products online with a good customer experience. Expanding our reach to offline will complement our strong online presence and cement our position as a leading player in the eyewear industry.”The omnichannel model has worked very well for different eyewear startups across the world. Warby Parker, an American direct-to-consumer eyewear brand was valued at $3 billion in its most recent financing, and India-based Lenskart that started in 2010 as an ecommerce platform for eyewear and now also operates over 500 retail stores across the country, raised funds at a reported valuation of $1.5 billion, in 2019.An Eyewa store in JeddahSo Eyewa’s move into retail makes a lot of sense but it means that it is going head-to-head with many established offline players with a large retail presence across the region. Its co-founder and co-CEO Anass Boumediene argues that their store concept is different (from the traditional retailers) at multiple levels, “We offer an omnichannel experience, and integrate virtual try-on in the stores for trying out products not displayed in the store and products that generally cannot be tried (color contact lenses). Eyewa also has exclusive in-house brands and collections that are made to fit the needs and wants of our local audiences. It allows us to offer high-quality products at a significantly lower price point than comparable products.”The in-house brands that the startup has built include lifestyle eyewear line 30Sundays, fast fashion collection Blackout, and natural color contact lenses range Layala. Each of them fulfills the untapped needs of the local market, noted the startup in a statement.In addition to expanding further into its existing markets, Eyewas is currently also exploring the opportunity in other markets of the Middle East & North Africa. It plans to use the latest funds to execute these expansion plans, and invest in “top-tier technology and product teams, as well as best in class retail and omnichannel technology.”Khaled Talhouni, Managing Partner of Nuwa Capital, commenting on the progress Eyewa has made so far, said, “We’ve been working with Anass and Mehdi since the beginning of their journey and it is such a privilege to have a front-row seat to the development of a company as remarkable as Eyewa. A big part of our thesis at Nuwa Capital is to focus on the next evolution of retail. The confluence of offline, online, and private label-driven commerce is at the heart of this thesis, and we would be hard-pressed to find a team that has executed as well as Eyewa has on this concept in the region. Joining this latest round of financing is a testament to our strong belief in the company and the team to deliver on building a unique regional champion for direct-to-consumer commerce.” Author Recent Posts Zubair Naeem ParachaFounder at MENAbytesA tech and startup enthusiast based in Lahore, Pakistan.

The benchmark 10-year rate is around 25 basis points below the 14-month peak touched at the end of March. That drop has helped spur the market’s roughly 1.5 per cent gain this quarter, shaving 2021 losses to about 2.8 per cent, according to Bloomberg Barclays index data through June 24.But many predicting higher 10-year yields by year-end see little having changed to alter their case, which is based in large part on expectations for the economy to continue to rebound and inflation to present more than a temporary threat.Growing speculation that the Fed will begin tapering its bond buying in 2021 has only emboldened their view. Short bets on Treasuries remain near the highest levels of the past few years, even after a sharp pullback following the Fed meeting, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. client survey shows.Bloomberg“The last three months have been a pretty slow slog for sure, but we are still bearish,” said Mike Schumacher, head of macro strategy at Wells Fargo. The bank predicts the 10-year yield will end 2021 in the 2.1 per cent to 2.4 per cent range -- its highest since 2019 -- compared with around 1.5 per cent now.“I suspect tapering would probably be a big trigger for higher yields,” said Schumacher. He says it’s conceivable the central bank begins the process of cutting its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases later this year. “And inflation helps that too,” he said, pushing back on the Fed’s mantra that price pressures will be a transitory result of the economy’s revival.Thoughts of WyomingClarity on the Fed’s asset purchases, which it introduced last year to support the economy and help markets function, may be a couple months away. Traders see growing odds that officials will communicate a change at the Fed’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in August.In the days ahead, though, the Labor Department’s Friday release of June jobs data looms large for the bond market, after both April and May figures were below consensus forecasts. The Fed has signaled that restoring full employment is a key goal as it assesses when to withdraw stimulus from the economy. The median projection is for a gain of almost 700,000 jobs, which would be the second-biggest increase since September.While the bears are showing resiliency, the debate over yields is far from over. A key bond-market metric known as the real yield, for example, shows that there’s still plenty of doubt about Wall Street’s rosy forecasts for growth.The long-time bullish rates analysts at HSBC Holdings Plc predict 10-year yields will take another swoon, to 1 per cent at the end of this year. They see trends such as demographics and swelling debt burdens persisting, while they expect the Fed during its coming tightening cycle to be able to lift its benchmark to a peak of only 1.25 per cent, from near zero now.BMO Capital Markets strategists also see a gravitational pull lower for yields. They predict the 10-year rate will hold between 1.35 per cent to 1.59 per cent for the next several weeks, with “an extended period of consolidation” appearing “far more likely than another fundamentally driven repricing.”Read More News onFedfederal reservebondsTreasury MarkettreasuryLabor departmenttaperingbond marketWells FargoBMO Capital Markets(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

Telegraph Money investigatesByJessica Beard27 June 2021 • 5:00amFewer than half of those on the new “simple” state pension actually receive the full amountCredit: TMGIn 2016 the Government unveiled the new “flat rate” state pension – but a Telegraph Money investigation has found that gaping inequalities continue to exist: some people get as little as 10p while others enjoy £550 a week.Millions of retirees receive drastically different payments each week as a legacy of the old pension system, which the Government is slowly winding down.However, nearly nine out of 10 pensioners are still on the “basic” state pension. This is because they began to draw their pensions before April 2016, when the new single-tier system replaced the old system of basic and earnings-related pensions.Close to 11 million people who receive the old state pension are likely to all be getting different amounts.A total of 1,400 people received 10p or less each week, while 20 people were paid £550 or more, figures obtained through a Freedom of Information request showed. The highest payouts amount to an income of £28,679 a year, more than triple the well-publicised flat rate of the new state pension, which is £9,350 a year or £179.60 a week.To qualify for the full amount you need to have made at least 35 years of qualifying National Insurance contributions or received credits for raising children or providing care. Our analysis found that fewer than half (46pc) of those on the new “simple” system actually received the full amount.Andrew Tully of Canada Life, the insurer, said the state system was difficult to navigate, making it hard for people to know how much they were due. “Often the state pension is far from generous, with the onus really on individuals to take responsibility to save if they wish to enjoy their retirement,” he said.The state pensionThose who enjoy the highest levels of state pension today would have to be in receipt of an additional earnings-related pension, commonly known as Serps, on top of their basic payment, which is currently £137.60. The maximum added by Serps is £180.31. Yet this figure can be boosted further.Delaying the start date for drawing a state pension raises the starting amount. By deferring the state pension by nine years, someone who would otherwise get £300 a week could boost their weekly income to more than £550. A state pension increases by 1pc for every five weeks deferred. Someone entitled to the new state pension of £179.60 a week could boost their annual income by £540 for every year they defer.One retiree who receives a lot more than the new flat rate is Malcolm Kerr, 72, who said he was paid £245 a week in the last tax year. This added up to nearly £13,000 a year. Mr Kerr, who started to receive the payments at age 65, said it was made up of the basic rate of £137.60 and two sets of additional state pension, as well as a deduction for a period when he had “contracted out”. Some people were contracted out of the additional state pension and paid lower National Insurance contributions as a result. This means their state pension may be lower.Mr Kerr said: “I had to pay more than the usual rate because I had earnings over a particular amount, so that has boosted my pension, but then I contracted out for a short time. It is a significant amount – I get nearly an extra £1,000 a month.”Sir Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and now a partner at the consultancy LCP, said: “Over time, most people coming up to pension age will get the standard amount. In the early years of the new system, some will get more because of past rights and some will get less because of past contracting out, but both of these effects will work their way out of the system.”'How I got my £7k state pension payout'The complexity of the old system led to hundreds of thousands of women being shortchanged by the Government for decades. In total, 200,000 women who were underpaid the state pension for years are due refunds totalling £2.9bn. Large numbers of elderly, widowed and divorced women were forced to get by on a reduced stipend for years thanks to a government oversight.Mr Tully urged all over-66s to check they were receiving the right amount. Gaps in National Insurance payments can be filled with credits for periods of unemployment or caring for children or elderly relatives. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: “In the past, people could receive very different amounts but this will not be the case in the future.”The DWP is proactively identifying all the women affected and has said it will pay out to everyone in full.Related TopicsState PensionTwitter IconFacebook IconWhatsApp IconEmail IconComment speech bubbleThe Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Pictured: Health workers doing Covid-19 tests at the St. Vincents Hospital drive-through testing clinic at Bondi Beach in Sydney June 26 amid latest outbreak, which has grown to 112 infections Anyone who was at Fonda Mexican restaurant (pictured) at Bondi Beach on June 18 between 1.50pm and 2.45pm has been told to contact NSW Health immediatelyAnyone who was at Fonda Mexican restaurant at Bondi Beach on June 18 between 1.50pm and 2.45pm must contact NSW Health immediately, get a test, and isolate for 14 days regardless of the result.The same advice applies to people who went to Mad Mex or Roll'd Vietnamese at Pacific Square in Maroubra, or Establishment Bar on George Street in the Sydney CBD - all at various times on June 23 and 24.

People who went to Mad Mex in Maroubra (pictured) on June 23 and 24 has also been told to isolate Anyone who was at Mecca Maxima or Mecca Cosmetica (pictured) between 3.30pm and 4.15pm has been told to isolate until a negative test is received Anyone who was at Establishment Bar on George Street in the Sydney CBD (pictured) on June 23 and 24 should isolate and get a testAnyone who was at Mecca Maxima or Mecca Cosmetica between 3.30pm and 4.15pm must isolate until a negative test result is received.The same goes for people who went to Cali Press in Double Bay on June 21, Fresh World fruit shop or Pacific Square in general in Maroubra at various times between June 23 and 24.Coles in Marrickville Metro has also been added to the growing list of exposure sites, with residents who visited the popular retailer on June 23 or 24 ordered to isolate until a negative test result is returned.Visitors to Liquorland at Marrickville Dewall on June 24 were given the same advice.When speaking at a press conference on Sunday morning, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the new infections are all linked to the Bondi cluster in Sydney's east. Police were roaming Bondi beach to ensure anybody out and about was exercising and following lockdown orders One of the people linked to this cluster includes a Virgin Australia flight attendant who tested positive after working as a crew member on five flights between Brisbane , Melbourne , Sydney and the Gold Coast on Friday and Saturday She denied delaying the city-wide lockdown to save face after previously stating she would never take such drastic measures again.Ms Berejiklian thrust the city into a two-week lockdown as cases spread further away from the eastern suburbs, and on Sunday Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant gave no guarantee that the lockdown would be lifted on July 9 as scheduled. Of the 30 new cases, 10 are linked to the Great Ocean Foods seafood wholesaler in Marrickville. This brings the total number of cases acquired through that cluster to 11, as well as the original case who worked there during their infectious period. One of the people linked to this cluster includes a Virgin Australia flight attendant who tested positive after working as a crew member on five flights between Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney and the Gold Coast on Friday and Saturday. Sydney streets were deserted on Sunday, the first full day of lockdown Western Sydney residents were spotted exercising at Parramatta Park on Sunday, the first full day of Sydney's two-week lockdownThat crew member is now in isolation while Virgin works to contact every team member who would be considered a close contact. 'Virgin Australia is requiring those crew members to cease flying, get tested and isolate. All passengers on flights the crew member operated will be contacted by health authorities and advised on the correct protocol,' it said. Eleven of the 30 new cases were in isolation for their entire infectious period, while three were quarantined for most of their infectious period. Another newly detected case attended the Westmead Hospital vaccination centre on June 22 without realising they were infectious, and subsequent contact tracing revealed they were a close contact of a previously known case. 'As a precaution we have called the people that attended that vaccine centre in a period before and after the case,' Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said. Police are conducting random stops (pictured in Parramatta on Sunday) to ensure people are complying with lockdown orders A Virgin flight attendant (not pictured) also tested positive for the virus on Saturday night after potentially being infectious on five flights through Sydney, Brisbane and MelbourneBut Dr Chant said there was every possibility the stay-at-home orders could extend beyond the scheduled two week period.She would be comfortable lifting lockdown if, toward the end of the two week period, new cases were only being identified in close contacts already in isolation. 'If we all take this very seriously (and) we maintain those testing numbers, then two weeks may be sufficient,' she said.Locals are only allowed to leave their houses for four reasons, which include for school or work if unable to do so from home, medical reasons including to get the vaccine and to give care, for essential shopping and to exercise outside in groups of no more than ten.'There is no curfew. You can leave your home at any stage to purchase any essential goods that you need to and that is a given. Be thoughtful and considerate about fellow citizens and no need to panic buy,' Ms Berejiklian assured the public on Saturday.'I said that this the scariest time since the pandemic started and that's proven to be the case.'Regional NSW will follow restrictions that were previously placed on Sydney which include having only five visitors at a house, wearing masks indoors, hospitality venues reduced to one person per square metre and outdoor venues reduced to 50 per cent capacity.

Chelsea Badger arrived in Perth a week ago for the funeral of her dad, Trevor Badger, after her was killed in a light plane crash in May. Badger was due to fly home to Auckland on Saturday evening, but five minutes before check-in began she was told there were no flights going to New Zealand due to the pause in the trans-Tasman travel bubble.CHELSEA BADGER/SuppliedChelsea Badger flew to Perth in Western Australia for her dad's funeral. The Government paused quarantine-free travel for three days, as Australia was hit by multiple cases and outbreaks of a contagious new strain of Covid-19.

She said she expected it may be at least a week before flights were back on again, so she was preparing to be in Australia for a while.CHELSEA BADGER/SuppliedChelsea Badger pictured with her partner Hailey, who is back in New Zealand while she is stuck in Australia. On Saturday night she spent over two and a half hours on hold with Air New Zealand to see if she could find out any more information about flights. “I was told there wouldn’t be any flights scheduled for at least the next 24 hours,” she said. The pause to the trans-Tasman bubble comes after Wellington moved to Covid-19 alert level 2 last Wednesday. Air New Zealand has cancelled all inbound passenger flights from Australia for 72 hours due to the trans-Tasman travel pause. Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins on Saturday night announced that all quarantine-free travel with Australia would pause from 10.30pm Saturday until 11.59pm Tuesday, June 29. ‘‘I acknowledge the frustration and inconvenience that comes with this pause, but given the high level of transmissibility of what appears to be the Delta variant, and the fact that there are now multiple community clusters, it is the right thing to do to keep Covid-19 out of New Zealand,’’ he said. Air NZ chief operational integrity and safety officer captain David Morgan confirmed a reduced number of passenger flights to Australia would still take-off over the next 72 hours, but all inbound flights from Australia had been cancelled. These flights would operate as cargo-only services. “We are in the process of contacting impacted customers, who are being provided the option to rebook, put their flight into credit, or receive a refund if they purchased a refundable ticket. “We appreciate our customers’ understanding and patience as our teams work to ensure they are kept up to date.”most popularCovid-19 NZ live: Cabinet has commissed advice around potentially making QR scanning compulsory, Ardern saysSurprise!

Pritesh Mehta June 27, 2021 / 08:25 AM IST For the last two weeks, the Nifty has been stuck in a non-trending phase. It was a cumulative play of multiple factors like strained upmove, the underperformance of banks, profit booking in broader markets, presence of multiple hurdles around 15,900 zone. This week's drop from day's high in Nifty, BankNifty in Wednesday's session & lack of any negative follow-through both on Thursday & Friday session highlights current congestion phase on Dalal Street.An index grappling with congestion (15,400-15,900) invariably shows such contrasts movement. It is essential for Nifty to stage a decisive move above multiple supply points between 15,850-15,900 to gain an upside momentum.Downside momentum has not been strong enough, which highlights the influence of support at play. So, buying on declines theory has worked out well. Going ahead, on sustenance above 15,900, Nifty could dash towards a three-digit Gann number of 163(00).Going by the action of the last two sessions, the market is clearly attempting to sustain at the top now. This week, Nifty found support around the midpoint of the entire move from the previous Friday's low to this week's high, implying immediate support around 15,650 zone.The previous two sessions have seen banks making a strong comeback. The ratio of the leadership index versus Nifty reversed from the support of its 200-DMA. Also, the pattern of higher lows continues to be intact on the ratio. Pullback & phase of outperformance is likely to set in within the banks. On the standalone chart, BankNifty has held on to point of polarity zone and its 100-DMA. Following a period of sideways correction, it has staged a breakout above the short-term trendline. On point & figure (P&F) chart (0.25 percent *3), bear trap reversal and double top buy are seen which is followed by ABC breakout, suggesting a plausible move towards 37,000.Close Related storiesPritesh MehtaLead Technical Analyst - Institutional Equities|YES Securities 'Keep Nifty & Bank Nifty aside and focus on these 3 sectors showing relative strength'Is the phase of Nifty’s outperformance vs bonds coming to an end?Index cools off, broader markets pick up momentum: Pritesh MehtaPost recent price correction, both Midcap 100 & Smallcap 100 indices have also bounced off the support zone. As per Friday's EOD data, around 84 percent of Nifty Midcap 100 components are trading above its 50-DMA; so, breadth has bounced in last one week. On June 18, there was around 80 percent of stocks from the midcap basket, trading above the same moving average.

Click here for full digital access to trusted news from the Herald Sun and Leader for just $1 a week for the first 12 weeks.Victoria will slam its borders shut to the Greater Darwin area from 8pm on Sunday night.The area - which incorporates the local government areas of Darwin, City of Palmerston and Litchfield - has been deemed a red zone under Victoria’s travel permit system.Passengers on flights to Victoria from Greater Darwin scheduled to depart before the red zone comes into effect can enter Victoria on green zone permits.All arrivals into Victoria must apply for a travel permit even if they are entering from a green zone.Non-Victorian residents who have visited a red zone, other than for transit, cannot obtain a permit and cannot enter Victoria. Victorian residents who have been in a red zone, other than for transit, can obtain a permit to enter Victoria but must travel directly home, get tested, and quarantine for 14 days.The school holiday rush at Melbourne Airport on Sunday. Picture: Tony GoughVictorians have also been urged to avoid travelling to NSW after its Covid infections spiked once again, with an alarming 30 cases overnightJust 11 of those cases had been in isolation throughout their infectious period.On the first day of a two-week lockdown for Greater Sydney, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced the major spike in cases, but all were linked to the Bondi cluster.It comes as more than 200 additional officers descended on the Victorian and NSW border, in a bid to keep potentially infectious Sydneysiders out of the state. Meanwhile, part of the Northern Territory will go into lockdown on Sunday, while restrictions will be reinstated in Perth. The NT regions of Darwin, Palmerston and Litchfield will enter a 48-hour lockdown from midday Sunday after four new cases of Covid-19 were recorded.And WA Health Minister Roger Cook announced Perth and Peel would go into stage one restrictions from 12pm Sunday after a physiotherapist from Perth tested positive to the Delta variant following a trip to Sydney. Among the restrictions are limits of 150 people for gatherings and no crowd at Optus Stadium for the West Coast Eagles-Western Bulldogs match later on Sunday.Acting Premier James Merlino said authorities were on high alert to unfolding coronavirus outbreaks across the country. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced 30 new cases in the state overnight. Picture: Brook Mitchell/Getty Images“We are obviously watching the situation in NSW extremely closely,” Mr Merlino said. “Keeping Victorians safe is our top priority.”It comes as two terminals of Melbourne Airport were declared Tier 2 coronavirus exposure sites overnight. Victorian Covid commander Jeroen Weimar urged Victorians to avoid NSW travel over the school holidays, saying “if you have a choice to go, don’t go”.“If you are in Victoria, only travel to NSW if you absolutely must and we discourage travel to NSW at this point,” he said.”For those citizens living in NSW, please only come to Victoria if you have to, and abide by our border and get tested when you do — 1500 people have applied for a red border permit, Victorians returning from the greater Sydney area. “We are keen to welcome them back into Victoria, but it is critical they isolate for 14 days at home without exception and they get a test within 72 hours of their arrival.”Victoria's Covid-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar has urged against travel to NSW. Picture: Darrian Traynor/Getty ImagesMr Weimar said his biggest concern was “more incursions” coming into Victoria. “We’re obviously very concerned … we’ve seen two incursions in the last few days from the New South Wales outbreak,” he said. He also urged returned travellers to get tested if they recently visited NSW.“I urge anyone who has been in NSW, you must get tested whether you returned today, last week,” Mr Weimar said.No new local cases have been detected in the Victorian community in the past 24 hours. More than 20,000 tests were carried out as Melburnians who had visited new exposure sites got tested, while almost 15,000 vaccines doses were delivered. Three new cases of coronavirus were acquired overseas and are in hotel quarantine, bringing the state’s active total to 44. DETAILS OF HOLIDAY INN EXPOSURE SITE LISTEDHoliday Inn Express Southbank has been declared a coronavirus exposure site, after an infectious Virgin cabin crew member stayed at the hotel.Health authorities had not listed the venue as site of concern until Sunday evening, despite flagging the airline worker may have been potentially infectious while staying at the hotel.Anyone who was on the 10th floor of the venue between 6.15pm-11.59pm on the 25th of June must get tested urgently and isolate until they have received a negative result.This also applies to anyone who was in the Ground Floor Lobby and The Great Room Bar and Restaurant between 6.00pm-6.45pm that same day and 6.00am-6.45am the following morning.Anyone who was at the hotel on the 25th of June between 6.00pm-11.59pm and 12.00am-6.45am the following day are also being urged to monitor for coronavirus symptoms.AIRPORT TERMINALS ON EXPOSURE LISTAnyone who was in the public areas of Melbourne Airport’s Terminal 2 between 6.30am-7.30am on Saturday, June 26 must get tested and isolate until they receive a negative result.This also applies to anyone who was in the public areas of Terminal 3 between 5.20pm and 6.50pm on Friday, June 25 and at the terminal from 8am-9am on June 26. Axil Coffee Roasters, which is located inside Melbourne Airport, has also been declared a Tier 2 exposure site for anyone that was there between 6.30am-7.30am on June 26.Additionally, Virgin Flight VA334 from Brisbane to Melbourne on June 25 has been declared a Tier 1 exposure as a case was on board that flight.Anyone who was on that 2.55pm-5.20pm flight must get tested immediately and quarantine for 14 days regardless of the result.The positive case was a crew member who was on board the Virgin Flight from Brisbane to Melbourne.Authorities have identified 128 passengers and 43 staff members who were on-board the flight from Brisbane to Melbourne on Friday June 25. “We are now in the process of contacting all those passengers,” Mr Weimar said. Chaotic scenes at Melbourne Airport‘s Terminal 3 on Sunday morning. Picture: Tony GoughThey have all been identified as primary close contacts and will be required to isolate for a full 14 days. In a statement, Virgin Australia said the crew member “always wore a face mask while on-board and when interacting with the public and adhered to infection control and Covid safe protocols.”It said all close contact team members will be removed from their rostered duties and be required to quarantine for 14 days.But the Transport Workers Union (TWU) slammed the federal government’s vaccine rollout program, saying the crew member worked on five flights while they were potentially infectious – including a flight to Melbourne – and walked through Melbourne Airport, leading to Terminal Two and Three being listed as exposure sites.TWU National Secretary Michael Kaine said it was “inexcusable” that workers were still not vaccinated four months into the rollout. “It is inexcusable that so many frontline workers, particularly those travelling interstate in tightly packed aircraft, have not been protected against a highly contagious virus that has gripped the globe for well over a year,” he said. “Aviation workers were among the first and most drastically affected by this pandemic.Flight staff gather at Melbourne Airport’s Terminal 2 on Sunday after it was declared an exposure site overnight. Picture: Tony Gough“The federal government’s failure to prevent Virgin’s collapse into administration, its failure to implement a national aviation plan, and its failure to ensure essential workers are vaccinated has caused undue suffering and stress to workers, damaged the economy and endangered our communities.”The federal government has repeatedly defended its rollout and blamed supply issues on global supply chain issues and the unforeseen rare blood clot issue with AstraZeneca’s restricting eligibility. More than 7 million doses have now been administered in Australia but just four per cent of the population is fully vaccinated. Many of the 7 million doses already delivered in Australia are first shots. Mr Kaine also criticised the NSW government and defended a driver who was the first person to test positive in the Sydney outbreak and worked in the quarantine system, driving international aircrew. The government questioned whether the driver underwent a daily Covid test or wore a mask at all times, but the NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller has since said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the man for breaching health directions. “Over recent days we have seen a driver linked to aviation brutally scapegoated by the NSW Government rather than admit to their failure to address known cracks in the system, which TWU’s NSW branch had previously raised as a concern,” Mr Kaine said. Sydney woke to its first full day of lockdown on Sunday. Picture: NCA NewsWire/Flavio Brancaleone“We ask the government to cease its condemnation of workers just trying to do their job and concentrate on the important task of keeping our communities safe.”Meanwhile, authorities are desperately attempting to identify any of the 900 miners from the Granites gold mine in the Northern Territory. So far, three miners who were onsite during the exposure period have declared they are currently in Victoria. Residents living in the Oakleigh apartment, where the man who brought the virus into Victoria from Sydney resides, are still being monitored by authorities. But all 49 residents have been tested and have returned a negative result. Residents aren’t under a full lockdown due to a lack of evidence that they were exposed to the virus. “We will be doing, out of an abundance of caution, day six and seven, and day 13 tests (for those residents),” Mr Weimar said. “They are able to move quite freely, but we will be following up with them over the coming days.”Meanwhile, 121 of the 131 passengers who were on the Jetstar flight from Sydney to Melbourne last Sunday have been tested. Passengers lining up for flights at Melbourne Airport on Sunday. Picture: Tony GoughHOLIDAY RUSH DESPITE OUTBREAK FEARSThe school holiday rush was back on at Melbourne Airport, with news of Covid scares in NSW and Queensland not deterring people from interstate travel.Terminal 3 was packed, with long lines and limited social distancing as staff worked to get the large numbers of masked travellers checked in.The Toomey family was all smiles on Sunday morning as they prepared to board a flight to Brisbane.Mum Natalie said they were looking forward to their first post-Covid interstate flight.“We’re a little bit nervous but everything seems pretty straight forward, we haven’t had any issues. We’re lucky (we weren’t going to Sydney),” she said.In arrivals, it was a little quieter with several cancelled Sydney flights freeing up space.Some NSW flights still landed though, such as the plane recently returned international travellers Paul Hyde, 41, and Simon Benson, 39, were on.Simon Benson and Paul Hyde with their eight-week-old baby, Lily. Picture: Tony GoughThe pair left Australia for Canada three months ago and returned home with an extra family member – their eight week-old daughter Lily – born via surrogate.Having just completed their two-week hotel quarantine in Sydney, Mr Hyde said they thankfully did not need to quarantine for an extra two weeks in Melbourne.“It wasn’t too bad actually,” he said.“We had food delivered and were in a one-bedroom apartment, so we could do washing for (Lily).“Getting back from the US isn’t as hard as getting back from Europe.”But not everyone was happy.Felix Gorza, who flew to Melbourne from Sydney, said interstate travel was “horrible” right now and lashed the government as incompetent.“You feel like a prisoner in your own country,” he said.Meanwhile, Terminal 2 was deserted. Picture: Tony GoughNEW BORDER RULES FOR NSW, ACTVictorian Health Minister Martin Foley said anyone from a NSW red zone would not be allowed into Victoria, with more than 260 police officers now working to prevent people entering the state from red zones. There will be “highly visible and highly mobile patrols” aimed at making it difficult for people to get across borders, he said. “Don’t come from a New South Wales red zone to Victoria, and for Victorians, do not visit those red zones in New South Wales,” he said. “If you run the risk of coming through the land borders from those red zones, you run the risk of substantial fines and being turned around, if not worse. Those fines can be $5000, on the spot. “And we need to make sure that we do everything that is necessary to keep Victorians safe. “We will enforce those border restrictions for the safety of every Victorian, and to make sure that we keep the Delta virus north of the river.”All travellers from regional New South Wales and ACT must get tested and isolate on arrival into Victoria after those areas were declared an orange zone in response to the growing coronavirus outbreak.It follows the announcement of a two-week lockdown imposed on Greater Sydney, Blue Mountains, Central Coast and Wollongong.An orange zone is deemed a medium risk for coronavirus transmission under Victoria’s travel permit system. Those entering Victoria from NSW and ACT must get tested within 72 hours of entering the state and have a travel permit. Travellers arriving from declared orange zones cannot isolate in Victoria’s alpine region.Additionally, Greater Sydney, including Central Coast, Shellharbour, Blue Mountains and Wollongong, have been declared an orange zone retrospectively between 11 June and 1am Friday June 2.This means those who have travelled to Victoria from Greater Sydney between these dates must get tested and isolate until they receive a negative result.The changes will come into effect from 1am on Sunday.Travellers can obtain permits by heading to service.vic.gov.au Peter and Allanah Watling with their seven-month-old baby Gigi and 3-year-old son Archie about to board the first flight to New Zealand as part of the travel bubble. Picture: Brad FleetNEW ZEALAND SUSPENDS TRAVEL BUBBLENew Zealand has suspended all quarantine free travel with Australia in response to the growing coronavirus outbreak around the country.The changes apply to all Australian states and territories and will kick-in this evening from 8.30pm Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST).The travel bubble will remain paused until next Tuesday at 10.00pm AEST.

The total income was at Rs 8,634.6 crore in the 2020 March quarter.On June 7, IndiGo Chief Financial Officer Jiten Chopra said the daily cash burn increased to Rs 19 crore in the March quarter from Rs 15 crore in the earlier quarter and given the current situation, the cash burn is expected to increase further in the June quarter.Emphasising that managing the cash position remains the primary focus, he had said, "we continue to work with all our stakeholders.

Shiba Inu is a dog breed. More specifically, the dog that is used in the Dogecoin memes is a Shiba Inu. Given the popularity of Dogecoin, the coin seems to have been created to benefit from that popularity.The coin is created by someone who is only known by the name Ryoshi. Little else is known about the founder. This is very similar to the case of bitcoin with Satoshi Nakamoto. A moniker that no one has claimed is them to this date.Related Reading | Crypto Isn’t Money, Annual Economic Report On Bitcoin5 BTC + 300 Free Spins for new players & 15 BTC + 35.000 Free Spins every month, only at mBitcasino. Play Now!Musk posted a cryptic tweet on his Twitter earlier today apparently in reference to a dog breed he’s getting. But the message behind the tweet was received loud and clear by the market.The tweet simply said, “My Shiba Inu will be named Floki.”After the tweet went live, the price of Shiba Inu rose quickly. Rising 23% in a couple of hours.Get 110 USDT Futures Bonus for FREE!More interestingly is the creation of another dog coin named Floki. The coin seems to have been created after Musk tweeted and now the coin is up a whopping 3,000 percent.Rise Of The Dog CoinsThe billionaire has always been a die-hard fan of Doge. Always tweeting in support of the coin and the project. He calls it the coin of the future. But it wasn’t until a couple of months ago that the billionaire’s tweets started leading the coin to pumps.With the movement of market prices after his tweets, people seem to have started to hang on to the billionaire’s every word. Putting money into a newly made coin just because he mentioned that he was going to name his dog that. Shiba Inu price pumps after Elon Musk's tweet | Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView.comThis is not the first time that Elon Musk has mentioned Shiba Inu. He made reference to the coin earlier in March when he tweeted that he was going to get a new dog. A Shiba Inu breed. The tweet read, “I’m getting a Shiba Inu. #resistanceisfutile.”The tweet made no mention of the coin itself. But nonetheless, people took it as such and the coin pumped. SHIB, as the Shiba Inu coin is commonly known, has pretty much followed the pattern of Dogecoin ever since. Rising and falling accordingly whenever Musk tweeted and people bought the coin.Doge And Subsequent Dog CoinsThere have been a number of meme coins made as a nod to the Dogecoin. Coins like the DogeFather, Shiba Inu, ShibaPup, and others. Shiba Inu touts itself as the Dogecoin killer.These coins have no use cases really. If anything, they are just coins made to pump and dump and make a quick buck from. There is nothing remarkable about the projects themselves.But the remarkable thing is how these coins seem to gain market value. Coins with seemingly nothing to offer the market somehow end up with a huge market valuation. Shiba Inu currently has a $7.32 billion market cap.Related Reading | Can Elon Musk Go To Prison For Manipulating Prices And Shilling Shitcoins?All of these coins have one thing in common; they are all in reference to dogs.Dogecoin itself that started all of it was created as a “tongue-in-cheek” joke towards bitcoin and the crypto market. It was not meant to do anything. Even the founders sold off all of their coins early on.Musk has been talking about getting a Shiba Inu for months now but has still not gotten one. And people are using his tweets to manipulate the market.Whether Musk meant the tweets to promote to coin is not known. But investors certainly think that’s what it’s meant to do.Musk has been talking about getting a Shiba Inu for months now but there is none in sight.Featured image from Observer, chart from TradingView.comTags: dogeDogecoinelon muskmeme coinsShiba InuTweetShareBitStarz Player Lands $2,459,124 Record Win!

As it is, the company has a goal of reaching 5,000 MW of renewables by 2025.Pixabay/andreas160578AC Energy lends P1 billion to Solar Philippines unit to fund new projectsIan Nicolas Cigaral (Philstar.com) - June 28, 2021 - 12:20pm MANILA, Philippines — AC Energy Corp. is extending a P1-billion loan to a subsidiary of Solar Philippines Power Project Holdings Inc. to develop solar power projects in the country.In a disclosure to the stock exchange on Monday, the Ayala-led power company said it signed the loan deal with Provincia Investment Corp. last June 25, with Solar Philippines acting as sponsor under the agreement.The loan deal is part of AC Energy’s partnership with Solar Philippines, the company of businessman Leandro Leviste, son of Antique Rep. Loren Legarda. Under the agreement, Provincia Investment mortgaged to AC Energy the company’s real assets and its parent’s stake in one of its fully-owned subsidiaries.Earlier this year, AC Energy signed binding agreements with Provincia Investments for potential joint ventures, and took over Solar Philippines Central Luzon Corp. (SPCLC), another unit of Solar Philippines, to develop and operate solar plants in Central Luzon. The acquisition of SPCLC, in turn, allows AC Energy to earn stable dividend income from the operations of the solar power projects.Solar Philippines is planning to construct over one gigawatt (GW) of solar projects in the provinces of Batangas, Cavite, Nueva Ecija and Tarlac. If realized, the projects would include the first, second and third largest solar projects in the Philippines to date.This bodes well with the Ayala Group’s ambitious target to be Southeast Asia’s largest renewables producer by 2025. This was coupled with a goal to offload all of its investments in coal power by 2030 as it joins major conglomerates around the world in shifting to clean energy.AC Energy earlier announced it would finance the construction of two new solar plants cumulatively worth P6.1 billion in Central Luzon that would generate a combined energy output of 150 megawatts (MW) by 2022. The company is also investing in wind power in Vietnam.As of 12:10 p.m., shares in AC Energy were rallying 2.44%, bucking a downturn in the main index.

The company was trading 1.8% higher in the early afternoon Posts areaLatest1 of 3OldestLatest postsLatest posts 3.53pmCrypto gains despite UK Binance banBy Priscila Azevedo Rocha and Joanna OssingerBitcoin was trading 7 per cent higher this afternoon at $US34,456 ($45,378) and Ethereum rose 5.5 per cent to $US1,970 ($2,594) even after crypto exchange Binance Markets was banned by the UK’s financial watchdog from doing any regulated business in the country.Bloomberg this morning reported that it was one of the most significant moves to date by a regulator amid a global crackdown in the crypto industry.Binance Markets has until the evening of June 30 to confirm that it has removed all advertising and financial promotions, according to the Financial Conduct Authority’s register.Bitcoin and ethereum were higher in afternoon trade on Monday. Credit:BloombergThe exchange must also make clear on its website, social media channels and all other communications that it is no longer permitted to operate in the UK Binance Markets won’t be able to resume UK operations without prior written consent.While the target of the restrictions is a separate legal entity from Binance - the world’s biggest crypto exchange by reported turnover - the FCA edict specifies that the notice must be put on Binance.com and communication channels including the Binance mobile and desktop applications.Binance Markets “does not offer any products or services via the Binance.com website,” the global crypto exchange said Sunday on Twitter.“The Binance Group acquired BML May 2020 and has not yet launched its U.K. business or used its FCA regulatory permissions.”A Binance spokesman said via email that the FCA’s notice restricts, but doesn’t remove, permissions owned by Binance Markets.The move extends a regulatory crackdown on the cryptocurrency sector amid concerns about its potential involvement in money laundering and fraud.Binance withdrew an application related to the 5MLD - an anti-laundering directive - on May 17 following “intensive engagement from the FCA,” according to the watchdog, which said the action had been in train for some time.Bitcoin was higher in afternoon trading in Australia.Crypto bulls often interpret tough regulatory action as a sign that the market is maturing, and say the potential for a more robust safety net may entice more investors to enter the space.Binance announced the acquisition of an FCA-regulated entity last June along with plans for the launch of Binance UK.“A significantly high number of cryptoasset businesses are not meeting the required standards under the money laundering regulations, which has resulted in an unprecedented number of businesses withdrawing their applications,” an FCA spokesperson said.Of the firms assessed, more than 90 per cent have withdrawn applications following the FCA’s intervention.Bloomberg 3.16pmFormer Andrews advisor behind Crown’s threat to watchdogBy Patrick HatchVictorian premier Daniel Andrews’ former senior advisor Chris Reilly was behind a threat from Crown Resorts to call in the state’s gambling minister to halt the casino regulator’s push for stronger anti-money laundering controls.Victoria’s royal commission into the James Packer-backed casino giant heard on Monday from Crown’s regulatory and compliance boss Michelle Fielding, who issued the threat to a Victorian Commission for Gaming and Liquor Regulation (VCGLR) officer in May 2019, which has raised further questions over Crown’s close relationship with the Andrews government.Crown Resorts’ compliance chief Michelle Fielding (pictured giving evidence to the Victorian royal commission on Monday) agreed her comments to the gambling regulator were inappropriate. The inquiry heard last month that Ms Fielding responded “pretty aggressively” when VCGLR officer Jason Cremona wrote to Crown raising his concerns that the casino had failed to act on a key recommendation from its 2018 licence review, which was to start checking the identity of all high-rollers on “junket” tours to the casino.Ms Fielding told the commission on Monday she “didn’t choose to respond aggressively, I was asked to” by Crown’s then chief legal officer Joshua Preston.“Do you think it’s an appropriate thing to do... to say you’re going to elevate it to the minister?” Counsel assisting the inquiry Penny Neskovcin, QC, asked.“Not really and to be honest with you I was uncomfortable with it,” Ms Fielding responded.Neskovcin: Then why did you do it?Fielding: Because that’s what he’d asked me to do.Read the full story here 3.04pmWholesalers on alert as Nike eyes new revenue recordsBy Alex DruceShares in sportswear giant Nike surged to new highs on Friday amid expectations its revenue will top $US50 billion ($65.8 billion) for the first time in 2021-22 as it rides a booming post-pandemic trade.But the company’s huge performance could also be a threat to certain Aussie retailers.Nike revenue could reach $US50 billion this year. Credit:GettyNike - a $US245 billion global retailer - hit a new record price of $US154.35 in New York after it reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results and tipped its growth to continue in line with a reopening North American economy.Bloomberg reports Nike has been gaining momentum as sports leagues and events resume in the US and Europe re-opens for business, driving renewed demand for its sneakers and apparel.But some analysts see the growth in Nike’s direct-to-customer channel as a medium-term risk for wholesalers such as Australia’s Accent Group, which owns the Athlete’s Foot, Glue, Platypus and Hype DC.Nike’s direct sales - which currently contribute 40 per cent of revenue - are expected to lift to 60 per cent by 2025.Citi’s Sam Teeger and Siraj Ahmed said this means wholesale partners such as Accent face a medium-term risk. Citi did however acknowledge Accent’s recent efforts to mitigate the issue.Accent is reportedly increasing the penetration of its licensed brands (e.g. Skechers, Vans) in its retail formats, especially Platypus, and is increasing focus on new formats with higher vertical margin potential e.g. Style Runner, the recently acquired Glue, and investment in new vertical brands such as Mindful Dept and Exie.“Accent has previously indicated Nike represents about 6 per cent of group sales, which we would expect translates to a lower proportion of profits,” Citi wrote.Citi is neutral on Accent and has a price target of $3.10. Shares in the company were last 2 per cent lower at $2.725 but are still up 15 per cent for the year.With BloombergAdvertisement 2.37pmEndeavour Group sails on its ownBy Lucy BattersbyEndeavour Group has set off on its own course with its separation from Woolworths taking effect at 12.01am this morning. Shares are up 4.2 per cent this afternoon to $6.35, adding $500 million to its market capitalisation, now at $11.4 billion. It is a good day for the consumer staples, with Woolworths up 2.9 per cent to $37.84, and Coles Group up 0.8 per cent to $16.97. Metcash is 1.1 per cent higher at $3.70 after getting up to $3.79 this morning after announcing strong full year results, a share buy back and a higher dividend. 2.15pmAutosports revs upBy Alex DruceLuxury car dealer Autosports Group was enjoying its best day in a month after tipping full-year revenue to accelerate on an improved Australian new car market.Shares in the $490 million firm rose by as much as 13 per cent in early trade, and were last 5.3 per cent higher at $2.57.Autosports said a strong demand for cars meant it expected sales for the 2021 year to be between $1.92 billion and $1.96 billion, an increase of 13 per cent to 15 per cent on last year.The dashboard of the Mercedes-Benz S450L.Net profit before tax will be between $68 million and $70 million, triple the 2020 figure.Autosports sells brands such as Audi, Volkswagon, Mercedes-Benz, Lamborghini and Jeep across 37 dealerships in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.It said the Australian new car market grew by 37.5 per cent between January and May, while vehicle servicing and parts sales have recovered as expected during the second half of 2021 driven by the easing of COVID-19 related restrictions in Victoria.Vehicle supply has been as expected despite some production limitations related to international semiconductor supply shortages.The company also announced the purchase of John Newell Mazda at Alexandria in Sydney. Completion will take place over the coming weeks.Elsewhere, rival car dealer Eagers Automotive was trading 1.5 per cent higher at $16.30, while Peter Warren Auto was down 1.4 per cent at $3.62. 2.05pmAustralian miners keep pushing for Canadian licencesBy Lucy BattersbyAnother Australian mining company has lodged applications for a coal mine in Alberta, Canada, just a week after Gine Rinehart’s Riversdale Resources Grassy Mountain project was knocked back by federal regulators over environmental concerns.It seems the provincial government of Alberta wooed miners by repealing a 1976 Coal policy in June 2020, but have since reinstated the policy and mining applications have been over-ruled by Canada’s federal government. Canada’s Alberta province planned to re-start coal mining to help with economic recovery after the pandemic. Credit:BloombergJameson Resources today told shareholders it had completed the Environmental Assessment of its Crown Mountain Hard Coking Coal Project, about 10 kilometres east of Grassy Mountain.“We believe the assessment confirms that the project can be developed and operated in a sustainable manner which minimises the risk of harm on the environment and establishes beneficial environmental offsets,″⁣ the board wrote in an ASX announcement.Now that it has completed the environmental assessment, which started seven years ago, Jameson will now wait for regulator queries.The Crown Mountain project is “a potential low-cost, high-quality, open cut metallurgical coal mine”. It is owned by NWP Coal Canada, which is 77.8 per cent owned by Jameson and 22.2 per cent owned by Bathurst Resources.Advertisement 1.12pmReturn of the pandemic trade? By Alex DruceSydney’s lockdown has meant the return of a couple of ASX trends first seen in the early stages of the pandemic last year.Supermarkets and alcohol retailers were buoyant on Monday as residents of the nation’s largest city stock up for the two-week stay-at-home order, while e-commerce names are again back in vogue.Woolies was up 2.6 per cent at $37.76, Coles added 0.3 per cent to $16.88, the Endeavour Group rose 3.6 per cent to $6.32, and IGA supplier Metcash jumped 1 per cent to $3.695.

Credit:Kate GeraghtyThe highly contagious Delta strain is also popping up in other areas of the country, perhaps heightening investor expectations that further restrictions may be required. As such, the market’s travel firms have been hammered, as have entertainment and hospitality establishments, and commercial property names.Qantas was 4.2 per cent lower at $4.525, while Sydney Airport fell 0.7 per cent to $5.820, and Regional Express sagged 2 per cent to $1.205.Among the travel brokers, Flight Centre fell 2.3 per cent to $14.73, Corporate Travel dropped 3 per cent to $20.83, Webjet was 3.8 per cent down at $4.87, and Helloworld was 3.1 per cent down at $1.59.Also lower were casinos The Star Group and Crown Resorts, Event Hospitality, Sealink Travel, Viva Leisure, Apollo Tourism, and the Redcape Hotel Group.Vicinity Centres fell 2.7 per cent to $1.60 and fellow mall owner Scentre was also 2.7 per cent down at $2.735.Stockland dropped 2.7 per cent, GPT Group fell 1.7 per cent, and Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield was 3.1 per cent lower.Ecommerce players, however, were enjoying a resurgence.Online art and fashion marketplace Redbubble was leading the ASX 200 for gains today, up 7.3 per cent to $3.68.Kogan wasn’t too far behind, rising 3.2 per cent to $12.59, with fellow electronics retailer Harvey Norman gaining 2.1 per cent to $5.27 and JB Hi-Fi up 0.4 per cent to $49.27.Temple and Webster gained 8.8 per cent to $11.37, Nick Scali was up 0.3 per cent to $10.80.Skincare firm BWX was up 1.9 per cent, Booktopia gained 1 per cent, and candle seller Dusk was 3.4 per cent ahead. 12.57pmWall Street’s red-hot start is leading to paranoiaBy Lu WangPeople were already worried about equities six months ago. Now, after the S&P 500 Index defied everything from nosebleed valuations to inflation to post one of the best first halves ever, they’re downright paranoid.Wall Street strategists, never ones to restrain their enthusiasm when it’s warranted, warn that the gains have played out. Short sellers are circling, with wagers against the largest equity exchange-traded fund rising to the highest level this year. Star investors like Michael Burry have warned of the “mother of all crashes” in meme stocks.About $US6 trillion has been added to Wall Street equity values already in 2021.Credit:NYSEAnd yet, from reversals in speculative names to a hawkish shift in Federal Reserve policy, things that could have put an end to last year’s rally in equities have failed to. Instead, amid steadfast retail buying, about $US6 trillion ($7.9 trillion) has been added to equity values in 2021, with the S&P 500’s 14 per cent rally putting it on course for its second-best January through June period since 1998.“The inflows of money are still so good,” Mike Wilson, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, said in an interview on Bloomberg TV and Radio. “The money does not leave the market. It just looks for another place to go.”While bears are getting bolder, the bulls have history on their side. In the 27 years when gains in equities were this strong through the first six months, three-quarters of the time stocks continued to march higher by December.The S&P 500 climbed for the fourth week in five as President Joe Biden’s bipartisan $US579 billion ($764 billion) infrastructure deal revived leadership in economically sensitive shares like banks and energy. The Russell 2000 Index of small-caps jumped more than 4 per cent, the most since March, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 advanced for six straight weeks, the longest winning streak in five months.Read the full story hereBloomberg 12.38pmWhat is the future of money? By Stephen BartholomeuszOpinionWhile there’s been a lot of focus on the language the Bank for International Settlements used to describe cryptocurrencies and stablecoins in a pre-released chapter of its annual report last week the more substantial take away from its paper lies not in that language but in the overall tone of its discussion of central bank-issued digital currencies.The major central banks have generally adopted an ultra-cautious and quite leisurely approach to their investigations of the potential of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and have been dismissive of the implications of cryptocurrencies and other private-sector digital currency initiatives.A radical redesign of an ever-evolving but centuries-old monetary system is looming larger and closer as the external pressures for change from privately sponsored and issued digital currencies intensify.Credit:APThe BIS paper underscores how rapidly that stance is evolving as the Basel institution, sometimes dubbed the central bank for central bankers, takes stock of the acceleration in the real-world development of digital currencies.While it remains dismissive of their potential threat to conventional monetary systems – cryptocurrencies are purely speculative assets used for nefarious purposes and stablecoins are just “an appendage to the conventional monetary system and not a game-changer” – the BIS has shifted from analyst to promoter of CBDCs.Part of the motivation for that change is that the BIS and the key central banks underestimated the pace and extent to which cryptocurrencies would become mainstream; the determination of the mega-tech companies to gate-crash the monetary system and the speed at which China would move to develop on introduce its own central bank-issued digital currency.Read the full article hereAdvertisement 12.26pmASX still weaker at lunchtimeBy Alex DruceThe ASX 200 remained subdued at lunchtime thanks to an uneven performance by the big banks and heavy losses for technology stocks, most notably Afterpay.The local benchmark was down 0.1 per cent at 7303.2, having slipped to a low of 7273.7 just before 11am AEST.Travel stocks and property firms remained blunted as Sydney entered the second full day of its two-week lockdown.Ecommerce names Kogan.com, Temple and Webster, Redbubble, Harvey Norman, and Booktopia were all higher, along with supermarkets Woolworths, Coles, and Metcash, and the Endeavour Group.BHP, Rio Tinto, and CSL were ahead while the major banks were down.Tech firms also sagged in the wake of the Nasdaq’s retreat on Friday. Afterpay was 7 per cent lower at $120.

A busy week on the US calendar will be important for the summer months. XAU/USD poised to extend slide after breaking key supportsUpdate: Gold price is struggling to recover ground above $1780, having found support at $1770 once again. Despite the uptick in the US dollar across the board, the risk-off market mood, in response to rising Delta covid strain concerns, underpins gold’s safe-haven appeal. Further, a minor retreat in the US Treasury yields across the curve amid dovish Fed expectations also offer some support to the non-yielding gold price. Looking ahead, gold price will remain at the mercy of the US dollar price action and risk trends, in absence of any first-tier US economic events, which makes it a quiet start to the NFP week.Read: Gold Weekly Forecast: Sellers look to retain control following uninspiring reboundAt the time of writing, gold is trading on the bid in the open for the week, higher by 0.38% from the get-go at $1,781.64. The price of gold has rallied from a low of $1,773.79 and has reached a high of $1,790.44. Gold prices finished on Friday at $1,780.30 and 0.29% higher after moving up from a low of $1,773.80 and reaching a high of $1,790.37.Meanwhile, the US dollar is flat in the open on Monday, stalling in its recovery from the pressure early on Friday following the miss in producer price inflation.The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 0.5%, below economists’ expectations of an 0.6% increase. There is no runaway inflation in this report, which counters the Fed’s faster action, weighing on the greenback.At the time of writing, DXY is trading at 91.81, a touch below the 91.838 Friday close. However, in the 12 months through May, the core PCE price index shot up 3.4%, the largest gain since April 1992.Meanwhile, volatility levels are sinking fast again following a brief hiatus around the FOMC meeting although there could be another flurry for the week ahead due to critical US data.Consumer confidence, ADP, ISM and Friday’s June Nonfarm Payrolls figure will be under the spotlight. A significant number, close to the one million mark, will be seeded to avert a low volatility summer.Analysts at TD Securities explained that the start of the process of preparing the market for QE tapering has introduced an additional hawkish element to Fed policy expectations.''The resulting sharp drop, which saw prices fall by some $100 to the $1,770s, and fear of a more pronounced rout also prompted money managers to build short positions. However, with the market reflecting on continued economic risks and yields remaining quite low, it is unlikely there will continue to be aggressive reductions in length.''''Indeed, once the dust settles, gold should migrate well above $1,800/oz in the next months with investors likely increasing exposure in the yellow metal, the analysts added. Gold technical analysisHowever, gold has failed to trade stronger into the $1800s and there is a lack of an immediate impetus to buy the yellow metal which puts the focus on the downside from a technical point of view.Chart of the Week: Gold meets a critical landmarkA close below 1,772 and 4-hour support will be important and will put the 1,750’s on the map for the bears. Previous updateUpdate: Gold (XAU/USD) prices hold lower ground near $1,780, down 0.09% intraday, despite the latest bounce off intraday low during Monday’s Asian session. While the US dollar pullback could be linked to the commodity’s latest U-turn, downbeat US Treasury yields and mildly bid stock futures are extra catalysts to help gold buyers lick their wounds.However, fears of the Fed action, backed by last week’s US Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, the Fed’s preferred gauge, probe gold’s short-term upside amid a lack of major data/events. It’s worth mentioning that the Fedspeak becomes the key driver to watch ahead of Friday’s US Nonfarm Payrolls as the policymakers keep rejecting reflation fears and seek confirmation from the key job report.Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Richard Logan Freeman, 52, a former heavyweight boxer and racing car driver, was put into bankruptcy on June 21. It’s understood he declared himself insolvent after the High Court awarded $350,000 in damages against him earlier this year for making defamatory remarks about earthquake advocate Bryan Staples. According to the Companies Office register, Freeman remains the director of three companies – Black and White Property, Onyx Homes and Franchise Business Systems South Island.Stacy Squires/StuffRichard Freeman pictured in 2005 with his Corvette racer built for the national Trans Am series. His Linkedin profile lists him as the managing director of Onyx Homes which sells home and land packages. His current occupation on his bankruptcy file lists him as a sales representative.

At the time Freeman and former police officer Mark Bouvet were lessees of the Sign of the Takahe restaurant and weddings venue. The pair released the lease in 2017 after trying to sell it on Trade Me.Staff Photographer/StuffRichard Freeman’s Hummer was well-known around Christchurch. In 2014, Freeman became a director of a company called Ironclad Securities which specialised in buying debts and collecting them. Fellow director Lyndon Richardson was a member of the notorious Headhunters gang and had been in jail for methamphetamine dealing offences. Freeman remained a director of the company between June and November 2014. Freeman’s name cropped up again in June this year when the High Court awarded $350,000 damages against him for making allegations about earthquake advocate Bryan Staples. Two intimidating men arrived at Staples’ address in 2014 and threatened to kill him if he did not pay. When Staples refused, allegations about him began appearing on Ironclad’s Facebook page. Freeman acknowledged he was the page’s moderator.Staff Photographer/StuffRichard Freeman helped establish debt collecting firm Ironclad Securities, which attracted police attention. In 2019 the Coroner held an inquest into the death of Freeman’s wife Priscilla Mary Rose Freeman who died on April 10, 2015 at the Chalet Motel in Hanmer Springs.

Philippines’ Voyager Innovations Secures US$167 M for PayMaya Expansion Into Financial Services, Digital BankingNew funding to advance Voyager’s thrust of enabling all Filipinos with digital financial services through PayMaya and its soon-to-be-established digital bank DownloadSmallPreviewThumbnailSmallPreviewThumbnailSmallPreviewThumbnailSmallPreviewThumbnailSmallPreviewThumbnailSmallPreviewThumbnailSmallPreviewThumbnailJune 28, 2021 12:03 AM Eastern Daylight TimeMANILA, Philippines--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Voyager Innovations (“Voyager” or the “Company”), the leading technology company in the Philippines, announced that it raised US$167 million to fast-track financial inclusion in the Philippines through its financial technology arm, PayMaya Philippines (“PayMaya”).Participating in the funding were existing shareholders PLDT Inc. (“PLDT”) (NYSE: PHI) (PSE: TEL), the Philippines’ largest integrated telecommunications company and leading digital services provider; KKR, a global investment firm; and Tencent, a leading technology company in China. Voyager welcomed IFC Financial Institutions Growth Fund, a fund managed by the IFC Asset Management Company (“IFC AMC”), as a new investor. IFC AMC is a division of the International Finance Corporation (“IFC”), a member of the World Bank Group, and an existing investor in Voyager.The fundraising marks another milestone for Voyager after having successfully grown PayMaya’s mobile wallet, payments processing, and digital remittance businesses. Voyager is now leveraging this unique ecosystem to expand into digital banking for the next phase of its mission to improve financial inclusion in the Philippines. Towards this end, it applied for a digital bank license with the country’s central bank, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (“BSP”).Voyager will use the new funds to expand its PayMaya services and to continue enabling more unbanked and underserved individuals and MSMEs with new and inclusive products, such as credit, insurance, savings, and investments, through a soon-to-be-established digital bank.Once granted a digital bank license by the BSP, the new entity will provide mobile-first, low-cost, round-the-clock, frictionless, branchless, ubiquitous, paperless, secure, and smart neo-banking services on the back of PayMaya’s proven technology platforms.Orlando B. Vea, Voyager and PayMaya CEO-Founder, said: “We have seen a quantum leap for digital payments adoption in the Philippines over the past year, and PayMaya has served as the nexus connecting consumers and enterprises with enriching digital finance experiences. This investment supports the unique value we bring and gives us a natural head start with the target market for the digital banking service.”Shailesh Baidwan, Voyager and PayMaya President, said: “As we did with payments and remittances, we will enable the large masses of Filipinos to leapfrog into a new stage of financial inclusion through integrated digital financial services. Our goal is to continue making lives better for millions of underserved people and small businesses, with cutting edge solutions that are affordable and relevant.”PayMaya has continually led the charge in fostering deeper adoption of digital payments across consumers, enterprises, and government, hitting crucial milestones despite COVID-19 quarantine measures imposed starting March 2020.These milestones include the strong consumer adoption of its PayMaya mobile wallet and Smart Padala by PayMaya remittance services. Total registered users for these consumer platforms doubled in just 18 months as of June 2021 to 38 million, or more than half of the adult population in the Philippines.PayMaya has also made it easier for Filipinos - whether banked or unbanked - to add money, cash out, make payments, and remit funds through more than 250,000 digital-finance access touchpoints, seven times the number of the ATMs and bank branches in the country. This expanded access is significant for an archipelagic nation where 33% of cities and municipalities do not have any banking presence.Combining the power of its enterprise and consumer businesses, PayMaya is spurring digital commerce in the Philippines through its PayMaya Mall, an in-app feature directly connecting over 350 enabled merchants to retail consumers.Its enterprise business saw exceptional growth, posting a four-fold increase in merchant acceptance points equipped with innovative payment solutions that accept credit, debit, and prepaid cards, as well as e-wallets, for both face-to-face and online transactions. Fueling this jump is the micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (“MSMEs”) segment, the focus of PayMaya’s rollout for innovative payment and financial services.Aside from enabling the payment acceptance for the largest e-Commerce, food, retail, and gas merchants in the Philippines, PayMaya equips over 70 national and social services agencies and local government units with digital payments and disbursement services. It is also the first financial technology company to adopt QR Ph, the national standard for merchant payments.In January this year, PayMaya began expanding its digital financial services offerings with "sachet" loans for MSMEs through its lending arm, PayMaya Lending Corp., and health and device protection products with insurance partners.PayMaya introduced its first lending product called Negosyo Advance last January among its 40,000-strong Smart Padala agent network--the most extensive network for domestic remittance and adjacent financial services in the country. Smart Padala agents are typically micro-entrepreneurs in communities who need short-term working capital loans for their day-to-day businesses.With insurance partners, PayMaya offers PayMaya Protect for health coverage, starting with COVID-19 and personal accidents. It also offers protection for mobile devices, with premiums that can cost less than Php1 (US$0.02)1 daily for cracked screens, water damage, and other incidents.PayMaya built this digital financial services expansion on the back of its strong consumer and enterprise payments businesses. It vastly deepens PayMaya's ecosystem with innovative digital- and mobile-first financial services that are accessible, affordable, and relevant to Filipino consumers and enterprises today. PayMaya will introduce other innovative services catering to underserved segments this year.In the Philippines, only one in three Filipino adults has a formal bank account and has loans. Of those who have loans, only 3% have borrowed from banks, and more than 77% and 75% of the population do not have insurance and investments, respectively.2 The country’s central bank aims to digitalize 50% of the total volume of retail payments and expand the financially included to 70% of Filipino adults by 2023.Voyager's latest fundraising underscores its leadership and its ability to continue growing an inclusive, sustainable, and diversified business that addresses the entire Philippines’ digital financial services market.This investment includes US$121 million in fresh funding and US$46 million from previously committed funds. KKR makes its investment from its Asia private equity fund. IFC Emerging Asia Fund, a fund managed by IFC AMC, is also an investor in Voyager.1USD 1 = Php 48.82Based on the BSP 2019 Financial Inclusion Survey ABOUT VOYAGER INNOVATIONS AND PAYMAYA PHILIPPINESVoyager Innovations, Inc. is the leading technology company in the Philippines, focused on customer-centric emerging market platforms for digital and financial inclusion.

REUTERS/Sergio Perez/File Photo Read MoreBARCELONA, June 28 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) will offer telecom operators Verizon (VZ.N) and Telefonica (TEF.MC) new services ranging from running 5G over a cloud platform to using artificial intelligence, the U.S. technology company said on Monday.Big technology players such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) are vying for a share of 5G revenue by offering telecom operators next-generation software tools.IBM, using technology it obtained from buying software firm Red Hat, will offer the telecom operators cloud services to run their networks and assist them in selling products tailored to customers. No financial terms were disclosed about the tie-ups, which broadened IBM's existing partnerships with the two firms.A cloud platform uses software instead of physical equipment to perform network functions, helping telecom operators build 5G networks faster, reduce costs and sell customised services."It's a disruptive time in this particular market segment, telcos are trying to position themselves as the destination for services like augmented reality, machine learning and AI," Darell Jordan-Smith, vice president of Redhat, told Reuters.On the AI front, IBM and Spain's Telefonica have created a virtual assistant that they say will remove friction points, such as long wait times, by automating the handling of frequently asked questions and tasks like billing."We see this as an existential moment for telco operators with 5G: architecturally, they're looking to gain more control on their platforms and rethink their network as a digital world rather than a structured physical model," said Steve Canepa, IBM's general manager for communications business.Reporting by Clara-Laeila Laudette and Supantha Mukherjee in BarcelonaOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.More from ReutersSign up for our newsletterSubscribe for our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest exclusive Reuters coverage delivered to your inbox.Sign upMedia & TelecomMedia & Telecom · June 27, 2021 · 8:51 AM UTCFreed U.S. editor says he was tortured in MyanmarMyanmar security forces punched, slapped and beat a U.S. journalist and kept him blindfolded for more than a week of interrogation, he said after being deported to the United States following over three months in detention.Media & TelecomEXCLUSIVE YouTube takes down Xinjiang videos, forcing rights group to seek alternativeJune 25, 2021Media & TelecomIndia's IT minister criticises Twitter for denying access to accountJune 25, 2021Media & TelecomPhilippines' Voyager raises $167 mln from KKR, Tencent, World Bank unit4:51 AM UTCMedia & TelecomWith cloud and AI, IBM broadens 5G deals with Verizon and Telefonica4:04 AM UTCBrowseWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigationsLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout ReutersCareersReuters News AgencyBrand Attribution GuidelinesReuters LeadershipReuters Fact CheckReuters Diversity ReportStay InformedDownload the AppNewslettersInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

It’s still hard to establish the whereabouts of Ameer and Raees Cajee, the pair that operated Johannesburg-based Africrypt since 2019The brothers appear to have vanished, along with an estimated R50 billion in BitcoinTheir cousin said the duo liked a "nice lifestyle," filled with luxury cars and traveling and that they started making money with crypto ventures at an early ageThe Cajee brothers, who ran a cryptocurrency investment platform from South Africa that the local regulator suspects of being a Ponzi scheme, are confounding both their family and desperate investors alike.It’s still hard to establish the whereabouts of Ameer and Raees Cajee, the pair that operated Johannesburg-based Africrypt since 2019. They appear to have vanished, along with an estimated $3.6 billion (around R50 billion) in Bitcoin - an amount that a lawyer for the brothers said was inflated.Attorney Gerhard Botha, who’s working on the firm’s liquidation case, said some of his clients last made contact with the brothers in May, and he was able to reach them before court proceedings kicked off in Johannesburg. But no "proactive response" was forthcoming from them, Botha said.A "To Let" sign could be spotted Saturday, fastened to a glass door of vacant office premises in Johannesburg’s upmarket Rosebank business hub that were listed in Africrypt’s communication with clients.Their cousin, Zakira Laher, said she was last able to make contact with the brothers in April and no one knows where they are. Raees Cajee directed all questions to a lawyer, John Oosthuizen, who wasn’t immediately available to comment.While Laher, 31, worked for the brothers briefly, she resigned from Africrypt in 2019 - her role was only to do some administrative work and provide legal advice as the company was getting started.The brothers liked a "nice lifestyle," filled with luxury cars and traveling - nothing unusual considering they started making money with crypto ventures at an early age, she said.The brothers halted their operations in April, along with a message to investors that Africrypt had been hacked and funds were missing.A lawyer assisting some of the clients said the missing Bitcoin totaled as much as $3.6 billion. Another firm, working on bankruptcy proceedings, said they are aware of about 62 clients that have about R140 million rand at risk - and possibly more coming forward.Africrypt’s Facebook page, with just two dozen followers, has also been eerily silent for weeks, punctuated by a rare entreaty from someone claiming to have been "totally duped".Oosthuizen, a lawyer for Raees and Ameer Cajee, told the BBC that the brothers maintain the company was the victim of a hack and "categorically denied" they had absconded with funds. Oosthuizen also suggested the $3.6 billion figure for the missing Bitcoin was an overestimate.Although the brothers never notified the police about the hack, they intend to cooperate with any future investigation, Oosthuizen told the BBC. They had received death threats and reacted by trying to keep themselves and their families safe, he said.It wasn’t clear if the lawyer knew of their whereabouts.Raising MoneyMuch of Africrypt’s marketing was achieved by word-of-mouth, said attorney Botha. The brothers will have to reply to the proceedings at the Johannesburg High Court by July 19, he said.Africrypt’s customer base spanned a variety of clients, from businesses and wealthy individuals to those who loaned money to keep up with their commitments."There were rich people, without a doubt," Botha said. "And people that invested their parents’ pension funds."An Africrypt investor presentation paints Raees, the younger brother, as a prodigy. He was first introduced to Bitcoin in 2009 and started a business when he was 13 years old, it said. Africrypt invested capital "in a variety of crypto currencies which the parties have verbally discussed and understood," according to a client contract.In a police statement from another investor seen by Bloomberg, Africrypt promised a fivefold return on the investment. The South African authorities are yet to take action against the elusive brothers.The Financial Sector Conduct Authority has said its hands are tied because cryptocurrency is not yet a regulated product in the country.We live in a world where facts and fiction get blurredIn times of uncertainty you need journalism you cantrust.

REUTERS/Issei Kato MELBOURNE, June 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Depressing trends lurk beneath Australia’s impressive economic rebound read more . Sharply curtailed migration and falling fertility during the pandemic have exacerbated the demographic challenges of an ageing population, according to the government’s first so-called Intergenerational Report in six years. The study, released on Monday, attempts to forecast long-term budget trends; it projects that the ratio of working-age people to those over 65 will tumble from 4 to 2.7 over the next 40 years.While acknowledging that immigration contributes to economic growth, Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s administration also slashed the cap on newcomers read more before Covid-19. He seems to be counting in part on labour productivity growth to make up the difference, which the analysis assumes will rebound to a 30-year average of 1.5% a year after growing at only 1.2% per year over the past decade. Other developed economies have been revising down their productivity estimates, and in fact Australia’s last intergenerational report overshot on fertility and population. This one could be excessively optimistic too.

Picture: Instagram/drybutwetSource:InstagramMore and more Aussies are saying no to hangovers.The popularity of non-alcoholic drinks has exploded in Australia and retailers are now scrambling to keep up with the demand.According to data from Endeavour Group, the parent company of BWS and Dan Murphy’s, sales of non-alcoholic drinks have increased more than 83 per cent in the past year.“The majority of customers are choosing non-alcoholic drinks because they want to moderate, which is a reflection of a broader trend of Australians drinking less but better,” Bree Coleman, Endeavour Group’s Head of Merchandise Transformation said.It’s a trend that Irene Falcone is well aware of. Last year she launched sansdrinks.com.au, a non-alcohol wine, beer and spirits online superstore.“Non-alcoholic drinks were so daggy when I discovered them,” Ms Falcone told news.com.au. “They just weren’t sexy, they didn’t taste good, and even the ones that did taste good, they couldn’t really be discovered because they were hidden. I thought, imagine if I could just pull out the really great ones and give them a voice, and that’s why I started sansdrinks.”Irene Falcone from sansdrinks.Source:SuppliedThe online store “went bananas” and motivated Ms Falcone to open a bottle shop selling only non-alcoholic drinks in Sydney’s northern beaches.The store stocks up to 400 products, including booze-free beer, wine and spirits.“The response has been overwhelming. At least four days a week I have a line-up outside!” Ms Falcone said.“90 per cent of my customers are people who drink but are trying to drink less or less often and they’re using my drinks as a direct substitute,” the business owner said.“For example, if people are going to a dinner party, a lot of customers tend to drink a bottle of alcoholic wine at dinner and then open up a couple of bottles of non-alcoholic wine after to lower the overall alcohol intake for the evening.”Ms Falcone told news.com.au the most popular category at the moment is non-alcoholic beer.“Soccer dads, they’re really interested in the new wave of Australian craft beers,” she said.“The next most popular would be wine. Right now everybody wants red wine. There’s a brand I sell called NEWBLOOD and they do a Shiraz and it is legit! It tastes exactly like red wine.”Inside sansdrinks.Source:SuppliedBree Coleman from Endeavour group said the quality of non-alcoholic drinks has increased substantially in recent times.“Non-alcoholic beer has been around for quite some time, and brewers have really managed to perfect a product that tastes like the alcoholic version,” she said. “Now, we are also seeing a great range of delicious non-alcoholic craft beers explode on the scene.“Many winemakers have spent the last few years refining methods to make non-alcoholic wines, and many craft the wines as they normally would, and then remove the alcohol, which means the wines have all the flavours, but none of the alcohol,” Ms Coleman added.This non-alcoholic Shiraz is 'legit' says Bree Coleman from Endeavour group. Picture: Instagram/drybutwetSource:InstagramAt the sansdrinks bottle shop in Sydney, Ms Falcone offers tastings and said customers are always surprised at how good the drinks taste.“They all say the same thing: ‘I once went into a supermarket or a liquor store and I bought some non-alcoholic wine and it tasted disgusting.’ And I say to them, ‘all that stuff you bought, that is here, it’s on the bottom shelf, it’s not stuff I recommend. But here is the real deal,’ and then I give them a few tasters to try and they always say, ‘wow!’”Ms Falcone now has plans to open up 20 more sansdrinks bottle shops around Australia in the next three years.Sansdrinks is not the only store that caters to Aussies who want to drink less. Brunswick Aces is an online store based out of Melbourne selling non-alcoholic drinks. It also has an actual bar (Brunswick Aces Bar) where customers can try over 100 non-alcoholic beers, wines, cocktails and mixed drinks.Brunswick Aces Bar, a non-alcoholic cocktail lounge in Melbourne.Source:SuppliedAnd both BWS and Dan Murphy’s are also expanding their range of non-alcoholic beverages to meet the increase in demand.A new and improved range of 200 products at Dan Murphy’s will be available nationally via online orders, and will be available in 20 physical stores to begin with from mid-July, just in time for Dry July.trending in lifestyle2338Lockdown: ‘Embarrassing’ reason we’re back to Covid, circa M...684Tiddlywink stuck up NZ woman’s nose for 37 years198Standard clothing sizes: Woman’s viral rant after large biki...178Victoria’s Secret model Bridget Malcolm shares tiny bra she ...98Non-alcoholic beverages exploding in popularity in AustraliaShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailBack to Top MORE IN foodCanadian ‘confused’ by Aussie coffeeWoolies’ new checkout featureAwesome cult drink coming to AustraliaWoolies shoppers lose it over $8 drinkFind usAdvertiseAbout UsNewslettersPremium membershipDownload the AppPrivacy PolicyRelevant Ad Opt-OutCookie PolicyTerms & ConditionsOur TeamCouponsLicencingConnectA NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

All IndiaSuvashree Ghosh and Ronojoy Mazumdar, BloombergUpdated: June 28, 2021 8:34 am ISTLatest World Gold Council data indicated Indian adults under age 34 have less appetite for gold.The cryptocurrency aficionados' mantra that Bitcoin is equivalent to digital gold is winning converts among the world's biggest holders of the precious metal.In India, where households own more than 25,000 tonnes of gold, investments in crypto grew from about $200 million to nearly $40 billion in the past year, according to Chainalysis. That's despite outright hostility toward the asset class from the central bank and a proposed trading ban.Richi Sood, a 32-year-old entrepreneur is one of those who swerved from gold to crypto. Since December, she's put in just over 1 million rupees ($13,400) - some of it borrowed from her father - into Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Ether.And she's been fortunate with her timing. She cashed out part of her position when Bitcoin smashed through $50,000 in February and bought back in after the recent tumble, allowing her to fund the overseas expansion of her education startup Study Mate India."I'd rather put my money in crypto than gold," Sood said. "Crypto is more transparent than gold or property and returns are more in a short period of time."She's part of a growing number of Indians -- now totalling more than 15 million -- buying and selling digital coins. That's catching up with the 23 million traders of these assets in the U.S. and compares with just 2.3 million in the U.K.The growth in India is coming from the 18-35 year old cohort, says the co-founder of India's first cryptocurrency exchange. Latest World Gold Council data indicated Indian adults under age 34 have less appetite for gold than older consumers."They find it far easier to invest in crypto than gold because the process is very simple," said Sandeep Goenka, who co-founded ZebPay and spent years representing the industry in discussions with the government on regulation. "You go online, you can buy crypto, you don't have to verify it, unlike gold."One of the biggest barriers preventing wider adoption is the regulatory uncertainty. Last year, the Supreme Court quashed a 2018 rule banning crypto trading by banking entities, resulting in a trading surge.However, authorities show no signs of embracing cryptocurrencies. The nation's central bank says it has "major concerns" about the asset class and six months ago the Indian government proposed a ban on trading in digital coins - though it has been silent on the topic since."I am flying blind," said Sood. "I have a risk-taking appetite, so I'm willing to take a risk of a ban."The official hostility though means many bigger individual investors are reluctant to speak openly about their holdings. One banker Bloomberg spoke to who invested more than $1 million into crypto assets said with no clear income tax rules at present he was concerned about the possibility of retrospective tax raids if he was publicly known to be a big-ticket crypto investor.He's already got contingency plans in place to move his trading to an offshore Singapore bank account if a ban was to be introduced.To be sure, the value of Indian digital asset holdings remain a sliver of its gold market. Still, the growth is clear, especially in trading -- the four biggest crypto exchanges saw daily trading jump to $102 million from $10.6 million a year ago, according to CoinGecko. The country's $40 billion market significantly trails China's $161 billion, according to Chainalysis.For now, the increasing adoption is another sign of Indians' willingness to take risk within a consumer finance sector that's plagued with examples of regulatory short falls."I think over time everyone is going to adopt it in every country," said Keneth Alvares, 22, an independent digital marketer who has invested more than $1,300 in crypto so far. "Right now the whole thing is scary with regulation but it doesn't worry me because I'm not planning to remove anything for now."PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com--With assistance from Swansy Afonso.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world.
